## Table of Contents

[TOC]

#### Transition from MediaWiki
The MediaWiki version of ATT&CK was moved to [attack-old.mitre.org](https://attack-old.mitre.org) and will remain up until the end of January 2019. The old website will not be receiving content updates during this timeframe, so you will need to use the new website and [STIX/TAXII](/resources/attack-data-and-tools) to get the most up-to-date ATT&CK information.

#### Consolidated Technique and Software IDs
 
As of the October 2018 update all techniques across Enterprise ATT&CK, PRE-ATT&CK, and Mobile will have the same T#### numbering scheme. Existing PRE-ATT&CK and Mobile technique IDs have been converted over to the Enterprise IDs. Links to specific pages on the old wiki or to the new site with the old IDs will hit pages that redirect to the appropriate technique page.
 
Mobile software IDs were converted to the Enterprise format of S####.

*NOTE: If you have created layers for the [ATT&CK Navigator](https://github.com/mitre/attack-navigator) that include PRE-ATT&CK or Mobile ATT&CK techniques, you will need to update your layer files to use the new ATT&CK technique IDs.*
 
#### Tactic IDs
 
Tactics have been given ID numbers formatted as TA####.

#### Mobile Mitigation IDs

Mobile migitations have been given ID numbers formatted as M####.
 
#### Versioning
 
We've implemented a versioning system to all ATT&CK objects (techniques, groups, software, Mobile mitigations) to enable better tracking of incremental changes to existing ATT&CK content. The system will consist of a MAJOR.MINOR number. All objects will start at version 1.0 with the October release.
 
**Techniques**

Major version changes

* Name change
* Technique scope change - Change in definition resulting in broadening or focusing the scope of the technique

Minor version changes

* Minor descriptive information - technical information, examples, detection, mitigation, references
* Metadata change - platform, permissions, data sources, defense bypassed, etc.
 
**Groups**

Major version changes

* Adding or changing associated group or software
* Big changes to description and scope of a group

Minor version changes

* Relationship to new techniques or software
* New references
 
**Software**

Major version changes

* Adding or changing an associated group or software
* High level description or information changes
* Metadata change (type)

Minor version changes

* Relationship to new techniques or software
* New references
 
**Mobile Mitigations**

Major version changes

* Name change
* Scope, description, or information changes

Minor version changes

* Metadata change
* Relationship to new techniques
* New references
 
In addition, the ATT&CK Matrix view of techniques within an ATT&CK domain will be timestamped with the last change that impacts its structure and organization which will act as a version number for it.
