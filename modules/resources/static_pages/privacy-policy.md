## Personal Information We Collect

### Personal Information You Give Us

MITRE may obtain your personal information when you interact with our
Site, for example, when you request information using the "**Contact
Us**" link. Personal information is data that identifies you, or could
reasonably be used to identify you, as an individual, such as your name
and email address.

### Information We Collect Automatically

We also may collect other information about your visits to our Site
using automated tools; for example, cookies and other passive
information collection technologies enable MITRE to compile aggregate
statistics concerning use of the Site, analyze trends, enhance the
security of the Site, deliver content, and otherwise administer
and improve the Site. This information may include your browser type,
language preference, operating system, device identifier, device type,
access time, Internet Protocol (IP) address, the URLs of websites you
visited before and after visiting our Site, the web search that landed
you on our Site, length of your visits to our Site, and the links you
click and pages you visit within our Site.

Your web browser may have settings that allow you to transmit a "**Do
Not Track**" signal when you visit various websites or use online
services. Like many websites, our Site is not designed to respond to
"**Do Not Track**" signals received from browsers. To learn more about
online tracking, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) provides guidance on
[How To Protect Your Privacy
Online](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-protect-your-privacy-online).

The ATT&CK website is hosted on GitHub®, which provides internet hosting
for software development and version control. When GitHub is visited,
the visitor\'s IP address is logged and stored for security purposes,
regardless of whether the visitor has signed into GitHub or not. For
more information about GitHub\'s privacy and security practices, see the
[GitHub Privacy
Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement).
MITRE and GitHub use a free third-party software service called Google
Analytics® to help us understand and analyze how visitors use our Site.
For more information on how Google Analytics uses data collected through
the Site, visit <https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/>. To
opt out of Google Analytics cookies, visit:

## Linked Websites

Our Site may include links to other websites that are not owned or
operated by MITRE. This Privacy Policy does not apply to those websites,
which may have their own privacy policies that you should review to
understand how they may collect, use, or disclose your personal
information. MITRE is not responsible for the content or privacy

## Security of Personal Information

MITRE maintains reasonable safeguards designed to protect personal
information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access,
disclosure, alteration, and destruction. MITRE employs encryption
technologies and user authentication procedures that are designed to
keep data secure. Nevertheless, transmission via the Internet and online
digital storage are not completely secure, so we cannot guarantee the
security of your personal information.

    regulations or compliance with a court order or binding law
    enforcement request.

-   We have a **legitimate interest** in processing your personal data
    and our reasons for using the personal data outweigh the potential
    prejudice to your data protection rights. In particular, we have a
    legitimate interest in the following instances:

    -   To analyze and improve the safety and security of our Site and
        services, including by implementing and enhancing security

    you consent, you may change your mind and withdraw your consent at
    any time by emailing us at
    [privacy@mitre.org](mailto:Privacy@mitre..org).

### Your Rights Under the GDPR

The GDPR provides individuals with certain rights regarding their
personal data. You may ask us to take the following actions:

    data and access to your personal data;

You may submit these requests by email to

require specific information from you to help us verify your identity
prior to processing your request. Applicable law may require or permit
us to decline your request. If we decline your request, we will tell you
why, subject to any legal restrictions on disclosing this information.

If you would like to submit a complaint about our use of your personal
data or our response to your request regarding your personal data, you
may contact us at
[privacy@mitre.org](mailto:privacy@mitre.org) or submit a
complaint directly to the data protection authority in your
jurisdiction. If you reside in the EEA, you can find information about
your data protection authority
[here](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en).
If you reside in the UK, you may file complaints with the Information
Commissioner's Office

### Our Retention of Your Personal Data

MITRE retains your personal data for no longer than is necessary to
achieve the purposes for which the personal data was collected, or as
may otherwise be permitted or required under applicable law. To
determine the appropriate retention period, we will consider the scope
and sensitivity of the personal data; the potential risk of harm from
unauthorized access to, use, or disclosure of the data; the purposes for
which we process the data; whether we can achieve our purposes through
other means; our business needs; and applicable legal requirements.
Unless otherwise required by applicable law, at the end of the retention
period, we will anonymize or securely destroy your personal data.

### Personal Data Transfers

By using this Site, you acknowledge that your personal data may be
collected, transferred to, and processed in jurisdictions outside your
own. When you directly provide your personal data through our Site, you
acknowledge that your personal data is being provided by you to a
company based in the United States. The laws that apply to personal data
protection in the United States differ from those applicable in the EEA
and the UK.

If it is necessary for us to transfer personal data out of the EEA and
the UK, we do so by using suitable data transfer mechanisms, such as the
standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, which
impose data protection obligations on parties to the transfer.
