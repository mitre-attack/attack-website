### Groups

On both Group and Software pages, we have changed the term “Aliases” to “Associated Groups” and “Associated Software” respectively to better reflect what these terms represent. Analysts track clusters of activities using various analytic methodologies and terms such as threat groups, activity groups, threat actors, intrusion sets, and campaigns. Some groups have multiple names associated with similar activities due to various organizations tracking similar activities by different names. Malware/software faces the same challenge with different organizations assigning different names to the same or similar samples. Organizations' group and software names may partially overlap with names designated by other organizations and may disagree on specific activity.

The MITRE ATT&CK team believes that tracking overlaps in activity for both groups and malware/software is useful to analysts, which is why we began tracking the “Aliases” field many years ago. While we always recognized that these were not true, complete “aliases,” we have realized that calling these “Aliases” only furthers the confusion over group naming. Thus, we have decided to change the field “Aliases” to “Associated Groups” and “Associated Software” to more accurately represent what we are trying to express. We make a best effort to track overlapping groups and software, but we do not represent these names as exact overlaps and encourage analysts to do additional research. If you have input on associated groups or software, please [contact us](/resources/engage-with-attack/contact).
