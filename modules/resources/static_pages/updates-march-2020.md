The March 2020 update for ATT&CK contains the beta release of sub-techniques for the Enterprise ATT&CK content. The beta site will be
separate from the main (and still official) ATT&CK content for a period of approximately 3 months to allow for feedback and for users to
assess their transition plans to ATT&CK with sub-techniques.

In total, the sub-technique version of ATT&CK for Enterprise contains 156 techniques (reduced from 266) and 260 sub-techniques.

See [the accompanying blog post](https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-subs-what-you-need-to-know-99bce414ae0b) for more details.
