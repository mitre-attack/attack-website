| [ATT&CK v5](/versions/v5) | July 31, 2019 | October 23, 2019 |  [v5.2 on MITRE/CTI](https://github.com/mitre/cti/releases/tag/ATT%26CK-v5.2) |

The July 2019 release focuses on changes to how Mitigations in ATT&CK for Enterprise are represented and updates the Groups and Software entries. It does not contain updates to techniques- a larger technique update is planned for later this year. We're happy to check off another box on our [planned changes this year](https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attacking-2019-c05bccefed2d), which was to modify how we represent mitigations in Enterprise so that the information is organized similar to how mitigations are handled in ATT&CK for Mobile.
 
Mitigations in Enterprise are now treated like categories and are represented by objects similar to Groups and Software- one example being "[Multi-factor Authentication](/mitigations/M1032/)". In the previous free-text mitigation fields, several techniques may reference multi-factor authentication as a potential way to mitigate a technique, but it was difficult to see which techniques a particular mitigation applies to without scouring the text fields across the techniques. Now each technique that a mitigation applies to will be associated to that mitigation category and the details of how each mitigation applies to a technique will appear in a table under the mitigations section. Each mitigation category has a page that lists all the techniques associated with it to give an at-a-glance view of coverage. In all, [40 new mitigation categories](/mitigations/enterprise/) were created based on a text analysis of each technique where we pulled apart the definitions and binned them into like categories to consolidate the mitigation information in Enterprise.
 
During the process of applying the new mitigation categories, we also did a bit of house cleaning on what mitigations are appropriate for certain techniques. We generally took the stance that if a mitigation does not directly apply to that specific behavior, then we removed it. For example, there were quite a few techniques that we removed application whitelisting (Execution Prevention) from because it was previously treated as a mitigation of last resort.
 
Mitigations are represented as courses of action in STIX and will have the same ID numbering as Mobile mitigations (M####). The old mitigation text for techniques were placed into temporary mitigations objects with the full text field and will be included as deprecated mitigation objects. They are listed in STIX objects for historical purposes, but will not be present in the website. Those mitigation objects are labeled with the same technique ID (T####) as the technique they were associated to.
 
The Effects tactic in ATT&CK for Mobile was renamed to Impact for consistency with the Enterprise Impact tactic.
 
We've also updated the [Enterprise tactic descriptions](/tactics/enterprise/) based on a contribution from Elly Searle at CrowdStrike to make them more straightforward, uniform, and easier to understand.
