<h2>Techniques</h2><h3>mobile-attack</h3><details><summary>New Techniques</summary><hr><h4>[T1626] Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may circumvent mechanisms designed to control elevated privileges to gain higher-level permissions. Most modern systems contain native elevation control mechanisms that are intended to limit privileges that a user can gain on a machine. Authorization has to be granted to specific users in order to perform tasks that are designated as higher risk. An adversary can use several methods to take advantage of built-in control mechanisms in order to escalate privileges on a system. </p><hr><h4>[T1640] Account Access Removal</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may interrupt availability of system and network resources by inhibiting access to accounts utilized by legitimate users. Accounts may be deleted, locked, or manipulated (ex: credentials changed) to remove access to accounts. </p><hr><h4>[T1638] Adversary-in-the-Middle</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 2.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may attempt to position themselves between two or more networked devices to support follow-on behaviors such as [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002) or [Endpoint Denial of Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1642).  

 

[Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1638) can be achieved through several mechanisms, such as a malicious application registering itself as a VPN client. By doing this, the adversary can effectively redirect device traffic to wherever they want. However, registering as a VPN client requires user consent on both Android and iOS. Additionally, on iOS, the application requires a special entitlement that must be granted by Apple. Alternatively, if an application is able to escalate privileges, it can potentially utilize those privileges to gain access to network traffic.  

 

Outside of a mobile device, adversaries may be able to capture traffic by employing a rogue base station or Wi-Fi access point. These devices will allow adversaries to capture network traffic after it has left the device, while it is flowing to its destination. On a local network, enterprise techniques could be used, such as DNS redirection or DNS poisoning.  

 

If applications properly encrypt their network traffic, sensitive data may not be accessible an adversary, depending on the point of capture. </p><hr><h4>[T1521.002] Encrypted Channel: Asymmetric Cryptography</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may employ a known asymmetric encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic, rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol. Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, uses a keypair per party: one public that can be freely distributed, and one private that should not be distributed. Due to how asymmetric algorithms work, the sender encrypts data with the receiver’s public key and the receiver decrypts the data with their private key. This ensures that only the intended recipient can read the encrypted data. Common public key encryption algorithms include RSA, ElGamal, and ECDSA.

For efficiency, many protocols (including SSL/TLS) use symmetric cryptography once a connection is established, but use asymmetric cryptography to establish or transmit a key. As such, these protocols are classified as [Asymmetric Cryptography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1521/002).</p><hr><h4>[T1481.002] Web Service: Bidirectional Communication</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service channel as a means for sending commands to and receiving output from a compromised system. Compromised systems may leverage popular websites and social media to host command and control (C2) instructions. Those infected systems can then send the output from those commands back over that Web service channel. The return traffic may occur in a variety of ways, depending on the Web service being utilized. For example, the return traffic may take the form of the compromised system posting a comment on a forum, issuing a pull request to development project, updating a document hosted on a Web service, or by sending a Tweet. 

 

Popular websites and social media, acting as a mechanism for C2, may give a significant amount of cover. This is due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection. </p><hr><h4>[T1624.001] Event Triggered Execution: Broadcast Receivers</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may establish persistence using system mechanisms that trigger execution based on specific events. Mobile operating systems have means to subscribe to events such as receiving an SMS message, device boot completion, or other device activities. 

An intent is a message passed between Android applications or system components. Applications can register to receive broadcast intents at runtime, which are system-wide intents delivered to each app when certain events happen on the device, such as network changes or the user unlocking the screen. Malicious applications can then trigger certain actions within the app based on which broadcast intent was received. 

In addition to Android system intents, malicious applications can register for intents broadcasted by other applications. This allows the malware to respond based on actions in other applications. This behavior typically indicates a more intimate knowledge, or potentially the targeting of specific devices, users, or applications. 

In Android 8 (API level 26), broadcast intent behavior was changed, limiting the implicit intents that applications can register for in the manifest. In most cases, applications that register through the manifest will no longer receive the broadcasts. Now, applications must register context-specific broadcast receivers while the user is actively using the app.(Citation: Android Changes to System Broadcasts) </p><hr><h4>[T1636.001] Protected User Data: Calendar Entries</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may utilize standard operating system APIs to gather calendar entry data. On Android, this can be accomplished using the Calendar Content Provider. On iOS, this can be accomplished using the `EventKit` framework. 

 

If the device has been jailbroken or rooted, an adversary may be able to access [Calendar Entries](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1636/001) without the user’s knowledge or approval. </p><hr><h4>[T1636.002] Protected User Data: Call Log</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may utilize standard operating system APIs to gather call log data. On Android, this can be accomplished using the Call Log Content Provider. iOS provides no standard API to access the call log. 

 

If the device has been jailbroken or rooted, an adversary may be able to access the [Call Log](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1636/002) without the user’s knowledge or approval. </p><hr><h4>[T1632.001] Subvert Trust Controls: Code Signing Policy Modification</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may modify code signing policies to enable execution of applications signed with unofficial or unknown keys. Code signing provides a level of authenticity on an app from a developer, guaranteeing that the program has not been tampered with and comes from an official source. Security controls can include enforcement mechanisms to ensure that only valid, signed code can be run on a device. 

Mobile devices generally enable these security controls by default, such as preventing the installation of unknown applications on Android. Adversaries may modify these policies in a number of ways, including [Input Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1516) or malicious configuration profiles.</p><hr><h4>[T1623] Command and Scripting Interpreter</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may abuse command and script interpreters to execute commands, scripts, or binaries. These interfaces and languages provide ways of interacting with computer systems and are a common feature across many different platforms. Most systems come with some built-in command-line interface and scripting capabilities, for example, Android is a UNIX-like OS and includes a basic [Unix Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1623/001) that can be accessed via the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) or Java’s `Runtime` package.

Adversaries may abuse these technologies in various ways as a means of executing arbitrary commands. Commands and scripts can be embedded in [Initial Access](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0027) payloads delivered to victims as lure documents or as secondary payloads downloaded from an existing C2. Adversaries may also execute commands through interactive terminals/shells. </p><hr><h4>[T1645] Compromise Client Software Binary</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may modify system software binaries to establish persistent access to devices. System software binaries are used by the underlying operating system and users over adb or terminal emulators. 

Adversaries may make modifications to client software binaries to carry out malicious tasks when those binaries are executed. For example, malware may come with a pre-compiled malicious binary intended to overwrite the genuine one on the device. Since these binaries may be routinely executed by the system or user, the adversary can leverage this for persistent access to the device. </p><hr><h4>[T1474.002] Supply Chain Compromise: Compromise Hardware Supply Chain</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may manipulate hardware components in products prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise. By modifying hardware or firmware in the supply chain, adversaries can insert a backdoor into consumer networks that may be difficult to detect and give the adversary a high degree of control over the system. </p><hr><h4>[T1474.001] Supply Chain Compromise: Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may manipulate products or product delivery mechanisms prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise. Applications often depend on external software to function properly. Popular open source projects that are used as dependencies in many applications may be targeted as a means to add malicious code to users of the dependency.(Citation: Grace-Advertisement)</p><hr><h4>[T1474.003] Supply Chain Compromise: Compromise Software Supply Chain</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may manipulate application software prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise. Supply chain compromise of software can take place in a number of ways, including manipulation of the application source code, manipulation of the update/distribution mechanism for that software, or replacing compiled releases with a modified version.</p><hr><h4>[T1636.003] Protected User Data: Contact List</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may utilize standard operating system APIs to gather contact list data. On Android, this can be accomplished using the Contacts Content Provider. On iOS, this can be accomplished using the `Contacts` framework. 

 

If the device has been jailbroken or rooted, an adversary may be able to access the [Contact List](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1636/003) without the user’s knowledge or approval. </p><hr><h4>[T1634] Credentials from Password Store</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may search common password storage locations to obtain user credentials. Passwords can be stored in several places on a device, depending on the operating system or application holding the credentials. There are also specific applications that store passwords to make it easier for users manage and maintain. Once credentials are obtained, they can be used to perform lateral movement and access restricted information.</p><hr><h4>[T1641] Data Manipulation</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may insert, delete, or alter data in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activity. By manipulating data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, or decision making.

The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the target application, process, and the goals and objectives of the adversary. For complex systems, an adversary would likely need special expertise and possibly access to specialized software related to the system, typically gained through a prolonged information gathering campaign, in order to have the desired impact.</p><hr><h4>[T1481.001] Web Service: Dead Drop Resolver</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service to host information that points to additional command and control (C2) infrastructure. Adversaries may post content, known as a dead drop resolver, on Web services with embedded (and often obfuscated/encoded) domains or IP addresses. Once infected, victims will reach out to and be redirected by these resolvers. 

 

Popular websites and social media, acting as a mechanism for C2, may give a significant amount of cover. This is due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection. 

 

Use of a dead drop resolver may also protect back-end C2 infrastructure from discovery through malware binary analysis, or enable operational resiliency (since this infrastructure may be dynamically changed). </p><hr><h4>[T1626.001] Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Device Administrator Permissions</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may abuse Android’s device administration API to obtain a higher degree of control over the device. By abusing the API, adversaries can perform several nefarious actions, such as resetting the device’s password for [Endpoint Denial of Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1642), factory resetting the device for [File Deletion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1630/002) and to delete any traces of the malware, disabling all the device’s cameras, or to make it more difficult to uninstall the app.

Device administrators must be approved by the user at runtime, with a system popup showing which actions have been requested by the app. In conjunction with other techniques, such as [Input Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1516), an app can programmatically grant itself administrator permissions without any user input.</p><hr><h4>[T1629.002] Impair Defenses: Device Lockout</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: An adversary may seek to inhibit user interaction by locking the legitimate user out of the device. This is typically accomplished by requesting device administrator permissions and then locking the screen using `DevicePolicyManager.lockNow()`. Other novel techniques for locking the user out of the device have been observed, such as showing a persistent overlay, using carefully crafted “call” notification screens, and locking HTML pages in the foreground. These techniques can be very difficult to get around, and typically require booting the device into safe mode to uninstall the malware.(Citation: Microsoft MalLockerB)(Citation: Talos GPlayed)(Citation: securelist rotexy 2018)

Prior to Android 7, device administrators were able to reset the device lock passcode to prevent the user from unlocking the device. The release of Android 7 introduced updates that only allow device or profile owners (e.g. MDMs) to reset the device’s passcode.(Citation: Android resetPassword)</p><hr><h4>[T1629.003] Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may disable security tools to avoid potential detection of their tools and activities. This can take the form of disabling security software, modifying SELinux configuration, or other methods to interfere with security tools scanning or reporting information. This is typically done by abusing device administrator permissions or using system exploits to gain root access to the device to modify protected system files.</p><hr><h4>[T1630.003] Indicator Removal on Host: Disguise Root/Jailbreak Indicators</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: An adversary could use knowledge of the techniques used by security software to evade detection.(Citation: Brodie)(Citation: Tan) For example, some mobile security products perform compromised device detection by searching for particular artifacts such as an installed "su" binary, but that check could be evaded by naming the binary something else. Similarly, polymorphic code techniques could be used to evade signature-based detection.(Citation: Rastogi)</p><hr><h4>[T1637.001] Dynamic Resolution: Domain Generation Algorithms</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may use [Domain Generation Algorithms](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1637/001) (DGAs) to procedurally generate domain names for uses such as command and control communication   or malicious application distribution.(Citation: securelist rotexy 2018)

DGAs increase the difficulty for defenders to block, track, or take over the command and control channel, as there could potentially be thousands of domains that malware can check for instructions.</p><hr><h4>[T1637] Dynamic Resolution</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may dynamically establish connections to command and control infrastructure to evade common detections and remediations. This may be achieved by using malware that shares a common algorithm with the infrastructure the adversary uses to receive the malware's communications. This algorithm can be used to dynamically adjust parameters such as the domain name, IP address, or port number the malware uses for command and control.</p><hr><h4>[T1642] Endpoint Denial of Service</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may perform Endpoint Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to degrade or block the availability of services to users.

On Android versions prior to 7, apps can abuse Device Administrator access to reset the device lock passcode, preventing the user from unlocking the device. After Android 7, only device or profile owners (e.g. MDMs) can reset the device’s passcode.(Citation: Android resetPassword)

On iOS devices, this technique does not work because mobile device management servers can only remove the screen lock passcode; they cannot set a new passcode. However, on jailbroken devices, malware has been discovered that can lock the user out of the device.(Citation: Xiao-KeyRaider)</p><hr><h4>[T1624] Event Triggered Execution</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may establish persistence using system mechanisms that trigger execution based on specific events. Mobile operating systems have means to subscribe to events such as receiving an SMS message, device boot completion, or other device activities. 

Adversaries may abuse these mechanisms as a means of maintaining persistent access to a victim via automatically and repeatedly executing malicious code. After gaining access to a victim’s system, adversaries may create or modify event triggers to point to malicious content that will be executed whenever the event trigger is invoked. </p><hr><h4>[T1627] Execution Guardrails</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may use execution guardrails to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied and environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target. Guardrails ensure that a payload only executes against an intended target and reduces collateral damage from an adversary’s campaign. Values an adversary can provide about a target system or environment to use as guardrails may include environment information such as location.(Citation: SWB Exodus March 2019)

Guardrails can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within. This use of guardrails is distinct from typical [System Checks](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1633/001). While use of [System Checks](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1633/001) may involve checking for known sandbox values and continuing with execution only if there is no match, the use of guardrails will involve checking for an expected target-specific value and only continuing with execution if there is such a match.</p><hr><h4>[T1639] Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over a different protocol than that of the existing command and control channel. The data may also be sent to an alternate network location from the main command and control server. 

Alternate protocols include FTP, SMTP, HTTP/S, DNS, SMB, or any other network protocol not being used as the main command and control channel. Different protocol channels could also include Web services such as cloud storage. Adversaries may opt to also encrypt and/or obfuscate these alternate channels. </p><hr><h4>[T1646] Exfiltration Over C2 Channel</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over an existing command and control channel. Stolen data is encoded into the normal communications channel using the same protocol as command and control communications.</p><hr><h4>[T1639.001] Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol: Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over an un-encrypted network protocol other than that of the existing command and control channel. The data may also be sent to an alternate network location from the main command and control server.

Adversaries may opt to obfuscate this data, without the use of encryption, within network protocols that are natively unencrypted (such as HTTP, FTP, or DNS). Adversaries may employ custom or publicly available encoding/compression algorithms (such as base64) or embed data within protocol headers and fields.</p><hr><h4>[T1630.002] Indicator Removal on Host: File Deletion</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may wipe a device or delete individual files in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activity. An application must have administrator access to fully wipe the device, while individual files may not require special permissions to delete depending on their storage location.(Citation: Android DevicePolicyManager 2019) 

Stored data could include a variety of file formats, such as Office files, databases, stored emails, and custom file formats. The impact file deletion will have depends on the type of data as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary, but can include deleting update files to evade detection or deleting attacker-specified files for impact.</p><hr><h4>[T1417.002] Input Capture: GUI Input Capture</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may mimic common operating system GUI components to prompt users for sensitive information with a seemingly legitimate prompt. The operating system and installed applications often have legitimate needs to prompt the user for sensitive information such as account credentials, bank account information, or Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Compared to traditional PCs, the constrained display size of mobile devices may impair the ability to provide users with contextual information, making users more susceptible to this technique’s use.(Citation: Felt-PhishingOnMobileDevices)

There are several approaches adversaries may use to mimic this functionality. Adversaries may impersonate the identity of a legitimate application (e.g. use the same application name and/or icon) and, when installed on the device, may prompt the user for sensitive information.(Citation: eset-finance) Adversaries may also send fake device notifications to the user that may trigger the display of an input prompt when clicked.(Citation: Group IB Gustuff Mar 2019) 

Additionally, adversaries may display a prompt on top of a running, legitimate application to trick users into entering sensitive information into a malicious application rather than the legitimate application. Typically, adversaries need to know when the targeted application and the individual activity within the targeted application is running in the foreground to display the prompt at the proper time. Adversaries can abuse Android’s accessibility features to determine which application is currently in the foreground.(Citation: ThreatFabric Cerberus) Two known approaches to displaying a prompt include:

* Adversaries start a new activity on top of a running legitimate application.(Citation: Felt-PhishingOnMobileDevices)(Citation: Hassell-ExploitingAndroid) Android 10 places new restrictions on the ability for an application to start a new activity on top of another application, which may make it more difficult for adversaries to utilize this technique.(Citation: Android Background)
* Adversaries create an application overlay window on top of a running legitimate application. Applications must hold the `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` permission to create overlay windows. This permission is handled differently than typical Android permissions and, at least under certain conditions, is automatically granted to applications installed from the Google Play Store.(Citation: Cloak and Dagger)(Citation: NowSecure Android Overlay)(Citation: Skycure-Accessibility) The `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` permission and its associated ability to create application overlay windows are expected to be deprecated in a future release of Android in favor of a new API.(Citation: XDA Bubbles)</p><hr><h4>[T1643] Generate Traffic from Victim</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may generate outbound traffic from devices. This is typically performed to manipulate external outcomes, such as to achieve carrier billing fraud or to manipulate app store rankings or ratings. Outbound traffic is typically generated as SMS messages or general web traffic, but may take other forms as well.

If done via SMS messages, Android apps must hold the `SEND_SMS` permission. Additionally, sending an SMS message requires user consent if the recipient is a premium number. Applications cannot send SMS messages on iOS</p><hr><h4>[T1627.001] Execution Guardrails: Geofencing</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may use a device’s geographical location to limit certain malicious behaviors. For example, malware operators may limit the distribution of a second stage payload to certain geographic regions.(Citation: Lookout eSurv)

[Geofencing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1627/001) is accomplished by persuading the user to grant the application permission to access location services. The application can then collect, process, and exfiltrate the device’s location to perform location-based actions, such as ceasing malicious behavior or showing region-specific advertisements. 

One method to accomplish [Geofencing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1627/001) on Android is to use the built-in Geofencing API to automatically trigger certain behaviors when the device enters or exits a specified radius around a geographical location. Similar to  other [Geofencing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1627/001) methods, this requires that the user has granted the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` and `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` permissions. The latter is only required if the application targets Android 10 (API level 29) or higher. However, Android 11 introduced additional permission controls that may restrict background location collection based on user permission choices at runtime. These additional controls include "Allow only while using the app", which will effectively prohibit background location collection.  

Similarly, on iOS, developers can use built-in APIs to setup and execute geofencing. Depending on the use case, the app will either need to call `requestWhenInUseAuthorization()` or `requestAlwaysAuthorization()`, depending on when access to the location services is required. Similar to Android, users also have the option to limit when the application can access the device’s location, including one-time use and only when the application is running in the foreground.  

[Geofencing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1627/001) can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within. For example, location data could be used to limit malware spread and/or capabilities, which could also potentially evade application analysis environments (ex: malware analysis outside of the target geographic area). Other malicious usages could include showing language-specific input prompts and/or advertisements.</p><hr><h4>[T1628] Hide Artifacts</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may attempt to hide artifacts associated with their behaviors to evade detection. Mobile operating systems have features and developer APIs to hide various artifacts, such as an application’s launcher icon. These APIs have legitimate usages, such as hiding an icon to avoid application drawer clutter when an application does not have a usable interface. Adversaries may abuse these features and APIs to hide artifacts from the user to evade detection.</p><hr><h4>[T1625] Hijack Execution Flow</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the way operating systems run applications. Hijacking execution flow can be for the purposes of persistence since this hijacked execution may reoccur over time. 

There are many ways an adversary may hijack the flow of execution. A primary way is by manipulating how the operating system locates programs to be executed. How the operating system locates libraries to be used by a program can also be intercepted. Locations where the operating system looks for programs or resources, such as file directories, could also be poisoned to include malicious payloads.</p><hr><h4>[T1629] Impair Defenses</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may maliciously modify components of a victim environment in order to hinder or disable defensive mechanisms. This not only involves impairing preventative defenses, such as anti-virus, but also detection capabilities that defenders can use to audit activity and identify malicious behavior. This may span both native defenses as well as supplemental capabilities installed by users or mobile endpoint administrators.</p><hr><h4>[T1430.002] Location Tracking: Impersonate SS7 Nodes</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may exploit the lack of authentication in signaling system network nodes to track the to track the location of mobile devices by impersonating a node.(Citation: Engel-SS7)(Citation: Engel-SS7-2008)(Citation: 3GPP-Security)(Citation: Positive-SS7)(Citation: CSRIC5-WG10-FinalReport) 

 

By providing the victim’s MSISDN (phone number) and impersonating network internal nodes to query subscriber information from other nodes, adversaries may use data collected from each hop to eventually determine the device’s geographical cell area or nearest cell tower.(Citation: Engel-SS7)</p><hr><h4>[T1630] Indicator Removal on Host</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may delete, alter, or hide generated artifacts on a device, including files, jailbreak status, or the malicious application itself. These actions may interfere with event collection, reporting, or other notifications used to detect intrusion activity. This may compromise the integrity of mobile security solutions by causing notable events or information to go unreported.</p><hr><h4>[T1634.001] Credentials from Password Store: Keychain</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may collect keychain data from an iOS device to acquire credentials. Keychains are the built-in way for iOS to keep track of users' passwords and credentials for many services and features such as Wi-Fi passwords, websites, secure notes, certificates, private keys, and VPN credentials. 

On the device, the keychain database is stored outside of application sandboxes to prevent unauthorized access to the raw data. Standard iOS APIs allow applications access to their own keychain contained within the database. By utilizing a privilege escalation exploit or existing root access, adversaries can access the entire encrypted database.(Citation: Apple Keychain Services)(Citation: Elcomsoft Decrypt Keychain) </p><hr><h4>[T1417.001] Input Capture: Keylogging</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may log user keystrokes to intercept credentials or other information from the user as the user types them.

Some methods of keylogging include:

* Masquerading as a legitimate third-party keyboard to record user keystrokes.(Citation: Zeltser-Keyboard) On both Android and iOS, users must explicitly authorize the use of third-party keyboard apps. Users should be advised to use extreme caution before granting this authorization when it is requested.
* Abusing accessibility features. On Android, adversaries may abuse accessibility features to record keystrokes by registering an `AccessibilityService` class, overriding the `onAccessibilityEvent` method, and listening for the `AccessibilityEvent.TYPE_VIEW_TEXT_CHANGED` event type. The event object passed into the function will contain the data that the user typed. 
*Additional methods of keylogging may be possible if root access is available. 
</p><hr><h4>[T1481.003] Web Service: One-Way Communication</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service channel as a means for sending commands to a compromised system without receiving return output. Compromised systems may leverage popular websites and social media to host command and control (C2) instructions. Those infected systems may opt to send the output from those commands back over a different C2 channel, including to another distinct Web service. Alternatively, compromised systems may return no output at all in cases where adversaries want to send instructions to systems and do not want a response. 

 

Popular websites and social media, acting as a mechanism for C2, may give a significant amount of cover. This is due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection. </p><hr><h4>[T1644] Out of Band Data</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 2.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may communicate with compromised devices using out of band data streams. This could be done for a variety of reasons, including evading network traffic monitoring, as a backup method of command and control, or for data exfiltration if the device is not connected to any Internet-providing networks (i.e. cellular or Wi-Fi). Several out of band data streams exist, such as SMS messages, NFC, and Bluetooth. 

 

On Android, applications can read push notifications to capture content from SMS messages, or other out of band data streams. This requires that the user manually grant notification access to the application via the settings menu. However, the application could launch an Intent to take the user directly there. 

 

On iOS, there is no way to programmatically read push notifications. </p><hr><h4>[T1629.001] Impair Defenses: Prevent Application Removal</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may abuse the Android device administration API to prevent the user from uninstalling a target application. In earlier versions of Android, device administrator applications needed their administration capabilities explicitly deactivated by the user before the application could be uninstalled. This was later updated so the user could deactivate and uninstall the administrator application in one step.

Adversaries may also abuse the device accessibility APIs to prevent removal. This set of APIs allows the application to perform certain actions on behalf of the user and programmatically determine what is being shown on the screen. The malicious application could monitor the device screen for certain modals (e.g., the confirmation modal to uninstall an application) and inject screen input or a back button tap to close the modal.</p><hr><h4>[T1631] Process Injection</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses or even elevate privileges. Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. 

Both Android and iOS have no legitimate way to achieve process injection. The only way this is possible is by abusing existing root access or exploiting a vulnerability.</p><hr><h4>[T1636] Protected User Data</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may utilize standard operating system APIs to collect data from permission-backed data stores on a device, such as the calendar or contact list. These permissions need to be declared ahead of time. On Android, they must be included in the application’s manifest. On iOS, they must be included in the application’s `Info.plist` file.  

 

In almost all cases, the user is required to grant access to the data store that the application is trying to access. In recent OS versions, vendors have introduced additional privacy controls for users, such as the ability to grant permission to an application only while the application is being actively used by the user. 

 

If the device has been jailbroken or rooted, an adversary may be able to access [Protected User Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1636) without the user’s knowledge or approval. </p><hr><h4>[T1631.001] Process Injection: Ptrace System Calls</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via ptrace (process trace) system calls in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Ptrace system call injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.  

Ptrace system call injection involves attaching to and modifying a running process. The ptrace system call enables a debugging process to observe and control another process (and each individual thread), including changing memory and register values.(Citation: PTRACE man) Ptrace system call injection is commonly performed by writing arbitrary code into a running process (e.g., by using `malloc`) then invoking that memory with `PTRACE_SETREGS` to set the register containing the next instruction to execute. Ptrace system call injection can also be done with `PTRACE_POKETEXT`/`PTRACE_POKEDATA`, which copy data to a specific address in the target process's memory (e.g., the current address of the next instruction).(Citation: PTRACE man)(Citation: Medium Ptrace JUL 2018)  

Ptrace system call injection may not be possible when targeting processes with high-privileges, and on some systems those that are non-child processes.(Citation: BH Linux Inject)  

Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via ptrace system call injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.</p><hr><h4>[T1430.001] Location Tracking: Remote Device Management Services</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: An adversary may use access to cloud services (e.g. Google's Android Device Manager or Apple iCloud's Find my iPhone) or to an enterprise mobility management (EMM)/mobile device management (MDM) server console to track the location of mobile devices managed by the service.(Citation: Krebs-Location) </p><hr><h4>[T1636.004] Protected User Data: SMS Messages</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may utilize standard operating system APIs to gather SMS messages. On Android, this can be accomplished using the SMS Content Provider. iOS provides no standard API to access SMS messages. 

If the device has been jailbroken or rooted, an adversary may be able to access [SMS Messages](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1636/004) without the user’s knowledge or approval. </p><hr><h4>[T1418.001] Software Discovery: Security Software Discovery</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of security applications and configurations that are installed on a device. This may include things such as mobile security products. Adversaries may use the information from [Security Software Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1418/001) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not to fully infect the target and/or attempt specific actions. </p><hr><h4>[T1406.002] Obfuscated Files or Information: Software Packing</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may perform software packing to conceal their code. Software packing is a method of compressing or encrypting an executable. Packing an executable changes the file signature in an attempt to avoid signature-based detection. Most decompression techniques decompress the executable code in memory. 

Utilities used to perform software packing are called packers. An example packer is FTT. A more comprehensive list of known packers is available, but adversaries may create their own packing techniques that do not leave the same artifacts as well-known packers to evade defenses.</p><hr><h4>[T1635] Steal Application Access Token</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries can steal user application access tokens as a means of acquiring credentials to access remote systems and resources. This can occur through social engineering or URI hijacking and typically requires user action to grant access, such as through a system “Open With” dialogue.  

Application access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user and are commonly used as a way to access resources in cloud-based applications and software-as-a-service (SaaS).(Citation: Auth0 - Why You Should Always Use Access Tokens to Secure APIs Sept 2019) OAuth is one commonly implemented framework used to issue tokens to users for access to systems. An application desiring access to cloud-based services or protected APIs can gain entry through OAuth 2.0 using a variety of authorization protocols. An example of a commonly-used sequence is Microsoft's Authorization Code Grant flow.(Citation: Microsoft Identity Platform Protocols May 2019)(Citation: Microsoft - OAuth Code Authorization flow - June 2019) An OAuth access token enables a third-party application to interact with resources containing user data in the ways requested without requiring user credentials.</p><hr><h4>[T1406.001] Obfuscated Files or Information: Steganography</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may use steganography techniques in order to prevent the detection of hidden information. Steganographic techniques can be used to hide data in digital media such as images, audio tracks, video clips, or text files.</p><hr><h4>[T1632] Subvert Trust Controls</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may undermine security controls that will either warn users of untrusted activity or prevent execution of untrusted applications. Operating systems and security products may contain mechanisms to identify programs or websites as possessing some level of trust. Examples of such features include: an app being allowed to run because it is signed by a valid code signing certificate; an OS prompt alerting the user that an app came from an untrusted source; or getting an indication that you are about to connect to an untrusted site. The method adversaries use will depend on the specific mechanism they seek to subvert. </p><hr><h4>[T1628.001] Hide Artifacts: Suppress Application Icon</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: A malicious application could suppress its icon from being displayed to the user in the application launcher. This hides the fact that it is installed, and can make it more difficult for the user to uninstall the application. Hiding the application's icon programmatically does not require any special permissions. 

This behavior has been seen in the BankBot/Spy Banker family of malware.(Citation: android-trojan-steals-paypal-2fa)(Citation: sunny-stolen-credentials)(Citation: bankbot-spybanker) 

Beginning in Android 10, changes were introduced to inhibit malicious applications’ ability to hide their icon. If an app is a system app, requests no permissions, or does not have a launcher activity, the application’s icon will be fully hidden. Further, if the device is fully managed or the application is in a work profile, the icon will be fully hidden. Otherwise, a synthesized activity is shown, which is a launcher icon that represents the app’s details page in the system settings. If the user clicks the synthesized activity in the launcher, they are taken to the application’s details page in the system settings.(Citation: Android 10 Limitations to Hiding App Icons)(Citation: LauncherApps getActivityList)</p><hr><h4>[T1521.001] Encrypted Channel: Symmetric Cryptography</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may employ a known symmetric encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic, rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol. Symmetric encryption algorithms use the same key for plaintext encryption and ciphertext decryption. Common symmetric encryption algorithms include AES, Blowfish, and RC4.</p><hr><h4>[T1633.001] Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion: System Checks</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may employ various system checks to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments. This may include changing behavior after checking for the presence of artifacts indicative of a virtual environment or sandbox. If the adversary detects a virtual environment, they may alter their malware’s behavior to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the implant. They may also search for virtualization artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads. 

Checks could include generic system properties such as host/domain name and samples of network traffic. Adversaries may also check the network adapters addresses, CPU core count, and available memory/drive size. 

Hardware checks, such as the presence of motion sensors, could also be used to gather evidence that can be indicative a virtual environment. Adversaries may also query for specific readings from these devices. </p><hr><h4>[T1625.001] Hijack Execution Flow: System Runtime API Hijacking</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the way an operating system run applications. Hijacking execution flow can be for the purposes of persistence since this hijacked execution may reoccur at later points in time. 


On Android, adversaries may overwrite the standard OS API library with a malicious alternative to hook into core functions to achieve persistence. By doing this, the adversary’s code will be executed every time the overwritten API function is called by an app on the infected device.</p><hr><h4>[T1641.001] Data Manipulation: Transmitted Data Manipulation</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may alter data en route to storage or other systems in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activity. By manipulating transmitted data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, or decision making.

Manipulation may be possible over a network connection or between system processes where there is an opportunity to deploy a tool that will intercept and change information. The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the target transmission mechanism as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary. For complex systems, an adversary would likely need special expertise and possibly access to specialized software related to the system, typically gained through a prolonged information gathering campaign, in order to have the desired impact.

One method to achieve [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1641/001) is by modifying the contents of the device clipboard. Malicious applications may monitor clipboard activity through the `ClipboardManager.OnPrimaryClipChangedListener` interface on Android to determine when clipboard contents have changed. Listening to clipboard activity, reading clipboard contents, and modifying clipboard contents requires no explicit application permissions and can be performed by applications running in the background. However, this behavior has changed with the release of Android 10.

Adversaries may use [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1641/001) to replace text prior to being pasted. For example, replacing a copied Bitcoin wallet address with a wallet address that is under adversarial control.

[Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1641/001) was seen within the Android/Clipper.C trojan. This sample was detected by ESET in an application distributed through the Google Play Store targeting cryptocurrency wallet numbers.(Citation: ESET Clipboard Modification February 2019)</p><hr><h4>[T1635.001] Steal Application Access Token: URI Hijacking</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may register Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to intercept sensitive data. 

Applications regularly register URIs with the operating system to act as a response handler for various actions, such as logging into an app using an external account via single sign-on. This allows redirections to that specific URI to be intercepted by the application. If an adversary were to register for a URI that was already in use by a genuine application, the adversary may be able to intercept data intended for the genuine application or perform a phishing attack against the genuine application. Intercepted data may include OAuth authorization codes or tokens that could be used by the adversary to gain access to protected resources.(Citation: Trend Micro iOS URL Hijacking)(Citation: IETF-PKCE) </p><hr><h4>[T1630.001] Indicator Removal on Host: Uninstall Malicious Application</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may include functionality in malware that uninstalls the malicious application from the device. This can be achieved by: 
 
* Abusing device owner permissions to perform silent uninstallation using device owner API calls. 
* Abusing root permissions to delete files from the filesystem. 
* Abusing the accessibility service. This requires sending an intent to the system to request uninstallation, and then abusing the accessibility service to click the proper places on the screen to confirm uninstallation.</p><hr><h4>[T1623.001] Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may abuse Unix shell commands and scripts for execution. Unix shells are the underlying command prompts on Android and iOS devices. Unix shells can control every aspect of a system, with certain commands requiring elevated privileges that are only accessible if the device has been rooted or jailbroken. 

Unix shells also support scripts that enable sequential execution of commands as well as other typical programming operations such as conditionals and loops. Common uses of shell scripts include long or repetitive tasks, or the need to run the same set of commands on multiple systems. 

Adversaries may abuse Unix shells to execute various commands or payloads. Interactive shells may be accessed through command and control channels or during lateral movement such as with SSH. Adversaries may also leverage shell scripts to deliver and execute multiple commands on victims or as part of payloads used for persistence. 

If the device has been rooted or jailbroken, adversaries may locate and invoke a superuser binary to elevate their privileges and interact with the system as the root user. This dangerous level of permissions allows the adversary to run special commands and modify protected system files.  </p><hr><h4>[T1628.002] Hide Artifacts: User Evasion</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may attempt to avoid detection by hiding malicious behavior from the user. By doing this, an adversary’s modifications would most likely remain installed on the device for longer, allowing the adversary to continue to operate on that device. 

While there are many ways this can be accomplished, one method is by using the device’s sensors. By utilizing the various motion sensors on a device, such as accelerometer or gyroscope, an application could detect that the device is being interacted with. That way, the application could continue to run while the device is not in use but cease operating while the user is using the device, hiding anything that would indicate malicious activity was ongoing. Accessing the sensors in this way does not require any permissions from the user, so it would be completely transparent.</p><hr><h4>[T1633] Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may employ various means to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments. This may include changing behaviors after checking for the presence of artifacts indicative of a virtual machine environment (VME) or sandbox. If the adversary detects a VME, they may alter their malware’s behavior to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the payload. They may also search for VME artifacts before dropping further payloads. Adversaries may use the information learned from [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1633) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors. 

Adversaries may use several methods to accomplish [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1633) such as checking for system artifacts associated with analysis or virtualization. Adversaries may also check for legitimate user activity to help determine if it is in an analysis environment. </p><hr><h4>[T1437.001] Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols associated with web protocols traffic to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. Commands to remote mobile devices, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the mobile client and server. 

Web protocols such as HTTP and HTTPS are used for web traffic as well as well as notification services native to mobile messaging services such as Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) and newly, Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), (GCM/FCM: two-way communication) and Apple Push Notification Service (APNS; one-way server-to-device).  Such notification services leverage HTTP/S via the respective API and are commonly abused on Android and iOS respectively in order blend in with routine device traffic making it difficult for enterprises to inspect. </p></details><details><summary>Major Version Changes</summary><hr><h4>[T1532] Archive Collected Data</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 2.0</p><p><b>Version changed from</b>: 1.0 → 2.0</p>

Android and iOS, by default, require that applications request device microphone access from the user.  

 

On Android devices, applications must hold the `RECORD_AUDIO` permission to access the microphone or the `CAPTURE_AUDIO_OUTPUT` permission to access audio output. Because Android does not allow third-party applications to hold the `CAPTURE_AUDIO_OUTPUT` permission by default, only privileged applications, such as those distributed by Google or the device vendor, can access audio output.(Citation: Android Permissions) However, adversaries may be able to gain this access after successfully elevating their privileges. With the `CAPTURE_AUDIO_OUTPUT` permission, adversaries may pass the `MediaRecorder.AudioSource.VOICE_CALL` constant to `MediaRecorder.setAudioOutput`, allowing capture of both voice call uplink and downlink.(Citation: Manifest.permission)

Android applications using the `RECORD_AUDIO` permission and iOS applications using `RequestRecordPermission` should be carefully reviewed and monitored. If the `CAPTURE_AUDIO_OUTPUT` permission is found in a third-party Android application, the application should be heavily scrutinized.

In some cases (e.g., the Samsung Knox warranty bit as described under Detection), the attack may be detected but could result in the device being placed in a state that no longer allows certain functionality.

Many Android devices provide the ability to unlock the bootloader for development purposes, but doing so introduces the potential ability for others to maliciously update the kernel or other boot partition code.

If the bootloader is not unlocked, it may still be possible to exploit device vulnerabilities to update the code.</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Adversaries may use scripts automatically executed at boot or logon initialization to establish persistence.

Samsung KNOX devices include a non-reversible Knox warranty bit fuse that is triggered "if a non-Knox kernel has been loaded on the device" (Citation: Samsung-KnoxWarrantyBit). If triggered, enterprise Knox container services will no longer be available on the device.

As described in the iOS Security Guide (Citation: Apple-iOSSecurityGuide), iOS devices will fail to boot or fail to allow device activation if unauthorized modifications are detected.

On Android, <code>ClipboardManager.OnPrimaryClipChangedListener</code> can be used by applications to register as a listener and monitor the clipboard for changes.(Citation: Github Capture Clipboard 2019)

For example, passwords being copied and pasted from a password manager application could be captured by a malicious application installed on the device.(Citation: Fahl-Clipboard) 

 

On Android, applications can use the `ClipboardManager.OnPrimaryClipChangedListener()` API to register as a listener and monitor the clipboard for changes. However, starting in Android 10, this can only be used if the application is in the foreground, or is set as the device’s default input method editor (IME).(Citation: Github Capture Clipboard 2019)(Citation: Android 10 Privacy Changes) 

 

On iOS, this can be accomplished by accessing the `UIPasteboard.general.string` field. However, starting in iOS 14, upon accessing the clipboard, the user will be shown a system notification if the accessed text originated in a different application. For example, if the user copies the text of an iMessage from the Messages application, the notification will read “application_name has pasted from Messages” when the text was pasted in a different application.(Citation: UIPPasteboard)</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[0]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-mobile-attack</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-attack</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[1]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>NIST Mobile Threat Catalogue</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Android 10 Privacy Changes</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[1]['url']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>https://pages.nist.gov/mobile-threat-catalogue/application-threats/APP-35.html</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>https://developer.android.com/about/versions/10/privacy/changes#clipboard-data</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[2]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Fahl-Clipboard</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>UIPPasteboard</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[2]['description']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Fahl, S, et al..

With this technique, the user's web browser is targeted for exploitation. For example, a website may contain malicious media content intended to exploit vulnerabilities in media parsers as demonstrated by the Android Stagefright vulnerability  (Citation: Zimperium-Stagefright).

(This technique was formerly known as Malicious Web Content. It has been renamed to better align with ATT&CK for Enterprise.)</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Adversaries may gain access to a system through a user visiting a website over the normal course of browsing. With this technique, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation, but adversaries may also use compromised websites for non-exploitation behavior such as acquiring an [Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/001).

Multiple ways of delivering exploit code to a browser exist, including:

* A legitimate website is compromised where adversaries have injected some form of malicious code such as JavaScript, iFrames, and cross-site scripting.
* Malicious ads are paid for and served through legitimate ad providers.
* Built-in web application interfaces are leveraged for the insertion of any other kind of object that can be used to display web content or contain a script that executes on the visiting client (e.g. forum posts, comments, and other user controllable web content).

Often the website used by an adversary is one visited by a specific community, such as government, a particular industry, or region, where the goal is to compromise a specific user or set of users based on a shared interest. This kind of targeted attack is referred to a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack. There are several known examples of this occurring.(Citation: Lookout-StealthMango)

Typical drive-by compromise process:

1. A user visits a website that is used to host the adversary controlled content.
2. Scripts automatically execute, typically searching versions of the browser and plugins for a potentially vulnerable version. 
    * The user may be required to assist in this process by enabling scripting or active website components and ignoring warning dialog boxes.
3. Upon finding a vulnerable version, exploit code is delivered to the browser.
4. If exploitation is successful, then it will give the adversary code execution on the user's system unless other protections are in place.
    * In some cases a second visit to the website after the initial scan is required before exploit code is delivered.</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse:

Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in an application, service, within the operating system software, or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security constructions, such as permission levels, will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques. Adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions. 

When initially gaining access to a device, an adversary may be operating within a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources on the system. Vulnerabilities may exist, usually in operating system components and applications running at higher permissions, that can be exploited to gain higher levels of access on the system. This could enable someone to move from unprivileged or user- level permission to root permissions depending on the component that is vulnerable. </td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[0]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-mobile-attack</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-attack</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_version</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>1.0</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2.0</td></tr></tbody></table></details><hr><h4>[T1541] Foreground Persistence</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 2.0</p><p><b>Version changed from</b>: 1.0 → 2.0</p><p><b>Dropped Mitigations</b>:</p><ul>  <li>M1005: Application Vetting</li></ul><details><summary>Details</summary><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>dictionary_item_added</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_attack_spec_version</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2.1.0</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_deprecated</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>False</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_domains</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>['mobile-attack']</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_modified_by_ref</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>identity--c78cb6e5-0c4b-4611-8297-d1b8b55e40b5</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Google.

On Android versions prior to 7, applications can obtain this information by executing the <code>ps</code> command, or by examining the <code>/proc</code> directory. Starting in Android version 7, use of the Linux kernel's <code>hidepid</code> feature prevents applications (without escalated privileges) from accessing this information (Citation: Android-SELinuxChanges).</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Adversaries may attempt to get information about running processes on a device. Information obtained could be used to gain an understanding of common software/applications running on devices within a network. Adversaries may use the information from [Process Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1424) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions. 

 

Recent Android security enhancements have made it more difficult to obtain a list of running processes. On Android 7 and later, there is no way for an application to obtain the process list without abusing elevated privileges. This is due to the Android kernel utilizing the `hidepid` mount feature. Prior to Android 7, applications could utilize the `ps` command or examine the `/proc` directory on the device.(Citation: Android-SELinuxChanges) 

 

In iOS, applications have previously been able to use the `sysctl` command to obtain a list of running processes. This functionality has been removed in later iOS versions. </td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[0]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-mobile-attack</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-attack</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_version</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>1.0</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2.0</td></tr></tbody></table><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>iterable_item_added</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_platforms</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>iOS</td></tr></tbody></table></details><hr><h4>[T1458] Replication Through Removable Media</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 2.0</p><p><b>Version changed from</b>: 1.1 → 2.0</p>

One use case for doing so is to identify the presence of endpoint security applications that may increase the adversary's risk of detection. Another use case is to identify the presence of applications that the adversary may wish to target.

On Android, applications can use methods in the PackageManager class (Citation: Android-PackageManager) to enumerate other apps installed on device, or an entity with shell access can use the pm command line tool.

On iOS, apps can use private API calls to obtain a list of other apps installed on the device. (Citation: Kurtz-MaliciousiOSApps) However, use of private API calls will likely prevent the application from being distributed through Apple's App Store.</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of applications that are installed on a device. Adversaries may use the information from [Software Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1418) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not to fully infect the target and/or attempts specific actions. 

 

Adversaries may attempt to enumerate applications for a variety of reasons, such as figuring out what security measures are present or to identify the presence of target applications. </td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>kill_chain_phases[0]['phase_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>defense-evasion</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>discovery</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[0]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-mobile-attack</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-attack</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[1]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Android-PackageManager</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>NIST Mobile Threat Catalogue</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[1]['url']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager.html</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>https://pages.nist.gov/mobile-threat-catalogue/application-threats/APP-12.html</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_version</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>1.0</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2.0</td></tr></tbody></table><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>iterable_item_removed</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>kill_chain_phases</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>{'kill_chain_name': 'mitre-mobile-attack', 'phase_name': 'discovery'}</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>{'source_name': 'Kurtz-MaliciousiOSApps', 'description': 'Andreas Kurtz.

Somewhat related, adversaries could also identify and exploit inadvertently present vulnerabilities. In many cases, it may be difficult to be certain whether exploitable functionality is due to malicious intent or simply inadvertent mistake.

Third-party libraries incorporated into mobile apps could contain malicious behavior, privacy-invasive behavior, or exploitable vulnerabilities. An adversary could deliberately insert malicious behavior or could exploit inadvertent vulnerabilities. For example, security issues have previously been identified in third-party advertising libraries incorporated into apps.(Citation: NowSecure-RemoteCode)(Citation: Grace-Advertisement).</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Adversaries may manipulate products or product delivery mechanisms prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise.

Supply chain compromise can take place at any stage of the supply chain including:

* Manipulation of development tools
* Manipulation of a development environment
* Manipulation of source code repositories (public or private)
* Manipulation of source code in open-source dependencies
* Manipulation of software update/distribution mechanisms
* Compromised/infected system images
* Replacement of legitimate software with modified versions
* Sales of modified/counterfeit products to legitimate distributors
* Shipment interdiction

While supply chain compromise can impact any component of hardware or software, attackers looking to gain execution have often focused on malicious additions to legitimate software in software distribution or update channels. Targeting may be specific to a desired victim set or malicious software may be distributed to a broad set of consumers but only move on to additional tactics on specific victims.  Popular open source projects that are used as dependencies in many applications may also be targeted as a means to add malicious code to users of the dependency, specifically with the widespread usage of third-party advertising libraries.(Citation: Grace-Advertisement)(Citation: NowSecure-RemoteCode)</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[0]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-mobile-attack</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-attack</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[1]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>NIST Mobile Threat Catalogue</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Grace-Advertisement</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[1]['url']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>https://pages.nist.gov/mobile-threat-catalogue/application-threats/APP-6.html</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>https://www.csc2.ncsu.edu/faculty/xjiang4/pubs/WISEC12_ADRISK.pdf</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[3]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Grace-Advertisement</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>NIST Mobile Threat Catalogue</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[3]['url']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>https://www.csc2.ncsu.edu/faculty/xjiang4/pubs/WISEC12_ADRISK.pdf</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>https://pages.nist.gov/mobile-threat-catalogue/application-threats/APP-6.html</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_detection</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>* Insecure third-party libraries could be detected by application vetting techniques.

Adversaries may use the physical camera devices on a mobile device to capture images or video. By default, in Android and iOS, an application must request permission to access a camera device which is granted by the user through a request prompt. In Android, applications must hold the `android.permission.CAMERA` permission to access the camera. In iOS, applications must include the `NSCameraUsageDescription` key in the `Info.plist` file, and must request access to the camera at runtime.</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>An adversary can leverage a device’s cameras to gather information by capturing video recordings. Images may also be captured, potentially in specified intervals, in lieu of video files.  

 

Malware or scripts may interact with the device cameras through an available API provided by the operating system. Video or image files may be written to disk and exfiltrated later. This technique differs from [Screen Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1513) due to use of the device’s cameras for video recording rather than capturing the victim’s screen. 

 

In Android, an application must hold the `android.permission.CAMERA` permission to access the cameras. In iOS, applications must include the `NSCameraUsageDescription` key in the `Info.plist` file. In both cases, the user must grant permission to the requesting application to use the camera. If the device has been rooted or jailbroken, an adversary may be able to access the camera without knowledge of the user.  </td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[0]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-mobile-attack</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-attack</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_detection</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>On Android and iOS, the user can view which applications have permission to use the camera through the device settings screen, and the user can choose to revoke the permissions.</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>The user can view which applications have permission to use the camera through the device settings screen, where the user can then choose to revoke the permissions.

Application vetting may be able to identify applications that perform Discovery or utilize existing connectivity to remotely access hosts within an internal enterprise network. </td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_domains</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>['mobile-attack']</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_is_subtechnique</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>False</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_modified_by_ref</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>identity--c78cb6e5-0c4b-4611-8297-d1b8b55e40b5</td></tr></tbody></table><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>dictionary_item_removed</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_old_attack_id</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>MOB-T1031</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td></tr></tbody></table><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>values_changed</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>modified</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2018-10-17 00:14:20.652000+00:00</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2022-04-06 12:45:44.023000+00:00</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>name</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Exploit Enterprise Resources</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Exploitation of Remote Services</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>description</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Adversaries may attempt to exploit enterprise servers, workstations, or other resources over the network. This technique may take advantage of the mobile device's access to an internal enterprise network either through local connectivity or through a Virtual Private Network (VPN).</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Adversaries may exploit remote services of enterprise servers, workstations, or other resources to gain unauthorized access to internal systems once inside of a network. Adversaries may exploit remote services by taking advantage of a mobile device’s access to an internal enterprise network through local connectivity or through a Virtual Private Network (VPN). Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for lateral movement to enable access to a remote system. 

An adversary may need to determine if the remote system is in a vulnerable state, which may be done through [Network Service Scanning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1423) or other Discovery methods. These look for common, vulnerable software that may be deployed in the network, the lack of certain patches that may indicate vulnerabilities, or security software that may be used to detect or contain remote exploitation. Servers are likely a high value target for lateral movement exploitation, but endpoint systems may also be at risk if they provide an advantage or access to additional resources.

Depending on the permissions level of the vulnerable remote service, an adversary may achieve [Exploitation for Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1404) as a result of lateral movement exploitation as well. </td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[0]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-mobile-attack</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-attack</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_version</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>1.0</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>1.1</td></tr></tbody></table></details><hr><h4>[T1420] File and Directory Discovery</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.1</p><p><b>Version changed from</b>: 1.0 → 1.1</p>

Malware may masquerade as a legitimate third-party keyboard to record user keystrokes.(Citation: Zeltser-Keyboard) On both Android and iOS, users must explicitly authorize the use of third-party keyboard apps. Users should be advised to use extreme caution before granting this authorization when it is requested.

On Android, malware may abuse accessibility features to record keystrokes by registering an `AccessibilityService` class, overriding the `onAccessibilityEvent` method, and listening for the `AccessibilityEvent.TYPE_VIEW_TEXT_CHANGED` event type. The event object passed into the function will contain the data that the user typed.

On Android, applications holding the `ACCESS_COAURSE_LOCATION` or `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permissions provide access to the device’s physical location. On Android 10 and up, declaration of the `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` permission in an application’s manifest will allow applications to request location access even when the application is running in the background.(Citation: Android Request Location Permissions) Some adversaries have utilized integration of Baidu map services to retrieve geographical location once the location access permissions had been obtained.(Citation: PaloAlto-SpyDealer)(Citation: Palo Alto HenBox) 

 

On iOS, applications must include the `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`, `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription`, and/or `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` keys in their `Info.plist` file depending on the extent of requested access to location information.(Citation: Apple Requesting Authorization for Location Services) On iOS 8.0 and up, applications call `requestWhenInUseAuthorization()` to request access to location information when the application is in use or `requestAlwaysAuthorization()` to request access to location information regardless of whether the application is in use.

### Biometric Spoofing
If biometric authentication is used, an adversary could attempt to spoof a mobile device's biometric authentication mechanism(Citation: SRLabs-Fingerprint)(Citation: SecureIDNews-Spoof)(Citation: TheSun-FaceID).

iOS partly mitigates this attack by requiring the device passcode rather than a fingerprint to unlock the device after every device restart and after 48 hours since the device was last unlocked (Citation: Apple-TouchID). Android has similar mitigations.

### Device Unlock Code Guessing or Brute Force
An adversary could attempt to brute-force or otherwise guess the lockscreen passcode (typically a PIN or password), including physically observing ("shoulder surfing") the device owner's use of the lockscreen passcode. 

### Exploit Other Device Lockscreen Vulnerabilities
Techniques have periodically been demonstrated that exploit vulnerabilities on Android (Citation: Wired-AndroidBypass), iOS (Citation: Kaspersky-iOSBypass), or other mobile devices to bypass the device lockscreen. The vulnerabilities are generally patched by the device/operating system vendor once they become aware of their existence.</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>An adversary with physical access to a mobile device may seek to bypass the device’s lockscreen. Several methods exist to accomplish this, including:

* Biometric spoofing: If biometric authentication is used, an adversary could attempt to spoof a mobile device’s biometric authentication mechanism. Both iOS and Android partly mitigate this attack by requiring the device’s passcode rather than biometrics to unlock the device after every device restart, and after a set or random amount of time.(Citation: SRLabs-Fingerprint)(Citation: TheSun-FaceID)
* Unlock code bypass: An adversaries could attempt to brute-force or otherwise guess the lockscreen passcode (typically a PIN or password), including physically observing (“shoulder surfing”) the device owner’s use of the lockscreen passcode. Mobile OS vendors partly mitigate this by implementing incremental backoff timers after a set number of failed unlock attempts, as well as a configurable full device wipe after several failed unlock attempts.
* Vulnerability exploit: Techniques have been periodically demonstrated that exploit mobile devices to bypass the lockscreen. The vulnerabilities are generally patched by the device or OS vendor once disclosed.(Citation: Wired-AndroidBypass)(Citation: Kaspersky-iOSBypass)

Network DoS can be performed by exhausting the network bandwidth that services rely on, or by jamming the signal going to or coming from devices. 

A Network DoS will occur when an adversary is able to jam radio signals (e.g. Wi-Fi, cellular, GPS) around a device to prevent it from communicating. For example, to jam cellular signal, an adversary may use a handheld signal jammer, which jam devices within the jammer’s operational range.(Citation: NIST-SP800187)

This is typically accomplished by utilizing device APIs to collect information about nearby networks, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular tower connections. On Android, this can be done by querying the respective APIs: 

 

* `WifiInfo` for information about the current Wi-Fi connection, as well as nearby Wi-Fi networks. Querying the `WiFiInfo` API requires the application to hold the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission. 

* `BluetoothAdapter` for information about Bluetooth devices, which also requires the application to hold several permissions granted by the user at runtime. 

* For Android versions prior to Q, applications can use the `TelephonyManager.getNeighboringCellInfo()` method. For Q and later, applications can use the `TelephonyManager.getAllCellInfo()` method. Both methods require the application hold the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission.</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[0]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-mobile-attack</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-attack</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_version</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2.0</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2.1</td></tr></tbody></table><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>iterable_item_removed</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>{'source_name': 'ConnMonitor', 'description': 'Anti Spy Mobile.

These commands may also include pointers to command and control (C2) infrastructure. Adversaries may post content, known as a dead drop resolver, on Web services with embedded (and often obfuscated/encoded) domains or IP addresses. Once infected, victims will reach out to and be redirected by these resolvers.

Popular websites and social media acting as a mechanism for C2 may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.

Performing SMS fraud relies heavily upon the fact that, when making SMS purchases, the carriers perform device verification but not user verification. This allows adversaries to make purchases on behalf of the user, with little or no user interaction.(Citation: Google Bread)

Malicious applications may also perform toll billing, which occurs when carriers provide payment endpoints over a web page. The application connects to the web page over cellular data so the carrier can directly verify the number, or the application must retrieve a code sent via SMS and enter it into the web page.(Citation: Google Bread)

On iOS, apps cannot send SMS messages.

On Android, apps must hold the `SEND_SMS` permission to send SMS messages. Additionally, Android version 4.2 and above has mitigations against this threat by requiring user consent before allowing SMS messages to be sent to premium numbers (Citation: AndroidSecurity2014).</p><font color=blue><p>This object has been revoked by [T1643] Generate Traffic from Victim</p></font><p><b>Description for [T1643] Generate Traffic from Victim</b>: Adversaries may generate outbound traffic from devices.

Ptrace system call injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.  

Ptrace system call injection involves attaching to and modifying a running process. The ptrace system call enables a debugging process to observe and control another process (and each individual thread), including changing memory and register values.(Citation: PTRACE man) Ptrace system call injection is commonly performed by writing arbitrary code into a running process (e.g., by using `malloc`) then invoking that memory with `PTRACE_SETREGS` to set the register containing the next instruction to execute. Ptrace system call injection can also be done with `PTRACE_POKETEXT`/`PTRACE_POKEDATA`, which copy data to a specific address in the target process's memory (e.g., the current address of the next instruction).(Citation: PTRACE man)(Citation: Medium Ptrace JUL 2018)  

Ptrace system call injection may not be possible when targeting processes with high-privileges, and on some systems those that are non-child processes.(Citation: BH Linux Inject)  

Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via ptrace system call injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.</p><details><summary>Details</summary><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>dictionary_item_added</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_attack_spec_version</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2.1.0</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_deprecated</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>False</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_domains</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>['mobile-attack']</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_modified_by_ref</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>identity--c78cb6e5-0c4b-4611-8297-d1b8b55e40b5</td></tr></tbody></table><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>values_changed</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>modified</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2020-03-29 04:07:06.663000+00:00</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2022-03-30 19:14:20.369000+00:00</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>revoked</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>False</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>True</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[0]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-mobile-attack</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-attack</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[1]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Shunix Code Injection Mar 2016</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Fadeev Code Injection Aug 2018</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[1]['description']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Shunix .

[Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1638) can be achieved through several mechanisms, such as a malicious application registering itself as a VPN client. By doing this, the adversary can effectively redirect device traffic to wherever they want. However, registering as a VPN client requires user consent on both Android and iOS. Additionally, on iOS, the application requires a special entitlement that must be granted by Apple. Alternatively, if an application is able to escalate privileges, it can potentially utilize those privileges to gain access to network traffic.  

 

Outside of a mobile device, adversaries may be able to capture traffic by employing a rogue base station or Wi-Fi access point. These devices will allow adversaries to capture network traffic after it has left the device, while it is flowing to its destination. On a local network, enterprise techniques could be used, such as DNS redirection or DNS poisoning.  

 

If applications properly encrypt their network traffic, sensitive data may not be accessible an adversary, depending on the point of capture. </p><details><summary>Details</summary><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>dictionary_item_added</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_attack_spec_version</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2.1.0</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_deprecated</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>False</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_detection</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_domains</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>['mobile-attack']</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_is_subtechnique</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>False</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_modified_by_ref</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>identity--c78cb6e5-0c4b-4611-8297-d1b8b55e40b5</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Jeffrey Cichonski, Joshua M Franklin, Michael Bartock.

They may also search for virtualization artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads. 

Checks could include generic system properties such as host/domain name and samples of network traffic. Adversaries may also check the network adapters addresses, CPU core count, and available memory/drive size. 

Hardware checks, such as the presence of motion sensors, could also be used to gather evidence that can be indicative a virtual environment.

One method to accomplish [Geofencing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1581) on Android is to use the built-in Geofencing API to automatically trigger certain behaviors when the device enters or exits a specified radius around a geographical location. Similar to other [Geofencing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1581) methods, this requires that the user has granted the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` and `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` permissions. The latter is only required if the application targets Android 10 (API level 29) or higher. However, Android 11 introduced additional permission controls that may restrict background location collection based on user permission choices at runtime.

Similarly, on iOS, developers can use built-in APIs to setup and execute geofencing.

Adversaries may mimic this functionality to prompt users for sensitive information.

Compared to traditional PCs, the constrained display size of mobile devices may impair the ability to provide users with contextual information, making users more susceptible to this technique’s use.(Citation: Felt-PhishingOnMobileDevices)

Specific approaches to this technique include:

### Impersonate the identity of a legitimate application

A malicious application could impersonate the identity of a legitimate application (e.g. use the same application name and/or icon) and get installed on the device. The malicious app could then prompt the user for sensitive information.(Citation: eset-finance)

### Display a prompt on top of a running legitimate application

A malicious application could display a prompt on top of a running legitimate application to trick users into entering sensitive information into the malicious application rather than the legitimate application. Typically, the malicious application would need to know when the targeted application (and individual activity within the targeted application) is running in the foreground, so that the malicious application knows when to display its prompt. Android 5.0 and 5.1.1, respectively, increased the difficulty of determining the current foreground application through modifications to the `ActivityManager` API.(Citation: Android-getRunningTasks)(Citation: StackOverflow-getRunningAppProcesses). A malicious application can still abuse Android’s accessibility features to determine which application is currently in the foreground.(Citation: ThreatFabric Cerberus) Approaches to display a prompt include:

* A malicious application could start a new activity on top of a running legitimate application.(Citation: Felt-PhishingOnMobileDevices)(Citation: Hassell-ExploitingAndroid) Android 10 places new restrictions on the ability for an application to start a new activity on top of another application, which may make it more difficult for adversaries to utilize this technique.(Citation: Android Background)
* A malicious application could create an application overlay window on top of a running legitimate application. Applications must hold the `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` permission to create overlay windows. This permission is handled differently than typical Android permissions, and at least under certain conditions is automatically granted to applications installed from the Google Play Store.(Citation: Cloak and Dagger)(Citation: NowSecure Android Overlay)(Citation: Skycure-Accessibility) The `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` permission and its associated ability to create application overlay windows are expected to be deprecated in a future release of Android in favor of a new API.(Citation: XDA Bubbles)

### Fake device notifications

A malicious application could send fake device notifications to the user. Clicking on the device notification could trigger the malicious application to display an input prompt.(Citation: Group IB Gustuff Mar 2019)</p><font color=blue><p>This object has been revoked by [T1417.002] GUI Input Capture</p></font><p><b>Description for [T1417.002] GUI Input Capture</b>: Adversaries may mimic common operating system GUI components to prompt users for sensitive information with a seemingly legitimate prompt.

Additionally, adversaries may display a prompt on top of a running, legitimate application to trick users into entering sensitive information into a malicious application rather than the legitimate application. Typically, adversaries need to know when the targeted application and the individual activity within the targeted application is running in the foreground to display the prompt at the proper time. Adversaries can abuse Android’s accessibility features to determine which application is currently in the foreground.(Citation: ThreatFabric Cerberus) Two known approaches to displaying a prompt include:

* Adversaries start a new activity on top of a running legitimate application.(Citation: Felt-PhishingOnMobileDevices)(Citation: Hassell-ExploitingAndroid) Android 10 places new restrictions on the ability for an application to start a new activity on top of another application, which may make it more difficult for adversaries to utilize this technique.(Citation: Android Background)
* Adversaries create an application overlay window on top of a running legitimate application. Applications must hold the `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` permission to create overlay windows. This permission is handled differently than typical Android permissions and, at least under certain conditions, is automatically granted to applications installed from the Google Play Store.(Citation: Cloak and Dagger)(Citation: NowSecure Android Overlay)(Citation: Skycure-Accessibility) The `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` permission and its associated ability to create application overlay windows are expected to be deprecated in a future release of Android in favor of a new API.(Citation: XDA Bubbles)</p><details><summary>Details</summary><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>dictionary_item_added</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_attack_spec_version</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2.1.0</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_deprecated</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>False</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_domains</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>['mobile-attack']</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_modified_by_ref</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>identity--c78cb6e5-0c4b-4611-8297-d1b8b55e40b5</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>A.P.

For example, FireEye researchers found in 2014 that 68% of the top 1,000 free applications in the Google Play Store had at least one Transport Layer Security (TLS) implementation vulnerability potentially opening the applications' network traffic to adversary-in-the-middle attacks (Citation: FireEye-SSL).</p><font color=blue><p>This object has been revoked by [T1638] Adversary-in-the-Middle</p></font><p><b>Description for [T1638] Adversary-in-the-Middle</b>: Adversaries may attempt to position themselves between two or more networked devices to support follow-on behaviors such as [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002) or [Endpoint Denial of Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1642).  

 

[Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1638) can be achieved through several mechanisms, such as a malicious application registering itself as a VPN client. By doing this, the adversary can effectively redirect device traffic to wherever they want. However, registering as a VPN client requires user consent on both Android and iOS. Additionally, on iOS, the application requires a special entitlement that must be granted by Apple. Alternatively, if an application is able to escalate privileges, it can potentially utilize those privileges to gain access to network traffic.  

 

Outside of a mobile device, adversaries may be able to capture traffic by employing a rogue base station or Wi-Fi access point. These devices will allow adversaries to capture network traffic after it has left the device, while it is flowing to its destination. On a local network, enterprise techniques could be used, such as DNS redirection or DNS poisoning.  

 

If applications properly encrypt their network traffic, sensitive data may not be accessible an adversary, depending on the point of capture. </p><details><summary>Details</summary><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>dictionary_item_added</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_attack_spec_version</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2.1.0</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_deprecated</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>False</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_detection</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_domains</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>['mobile-attack']</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_modified_by_ref</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>identity--c78cb6e5-0c4b-4611-8297-d1b8b55e40b5</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Adrian Mettler, Yulong Zhang, Vishwanath Raman.

* `WifiInfo` for information about the current Wi-Fi connection, as well as nearby Wi-Fi networks. Querying the `WiFiInfo` API requires the application to hold the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission. 

* `BluetoothAdapter` for information about Bluetooth devices, which also requires the application to hold several permissions granted by the user at runtime. 

* For Android versions prior to Q, applications can use the `TelephonyManager.getNeighboringCellInfo()` method. For Q and later, applications can use the `TelephonyManager.getAllCellInfo()` method. Both methods require the application hold the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission.</p><details><summary>Details</summary><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>dictionary_item_added</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_attack_spec_version</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2.1.0</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_deprecated</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>False</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_detection</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_domains</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>['mobile-attack']</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_is_subtechnique</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>False</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_modified_by_ref</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>identity--c78cb6e5-0c4b-4611-8297-d1b8b55e40b5</td></tr></tbody></table><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>values_changed</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>modified</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2019-07-10 15:18:16.753000+00:00</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2022-03-31 16:33:55.068000+00:00</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>revoked</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>False</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>True</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[0]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-mobile-attack</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-attack</td></tr></tbody></table></details><hr><h4>[T1410] Network Traffic Capture or Redirection</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: An adversary may capture network traffic to and from the device to obtain credentials or other sensitive data, or redirect network traffic to flow through an adversary-controlled gateway to do the same.

A malicious app could register itself as a VPN client on Android or iOS to gain access to network packets. However, on both platforms, the user must grant consent to the app to act as a VPN client, and on iOS the app requires a special entitlement that must be granted by Apple.

Alternatively, if a malicious app is able to escalate operating system privileges, it may be able to use those privileges to gain access to network traffic.

An adversary could redirect network traffic to an adversary-controlled gateway by establishing a VPN connection or by manipulating the device's proxy settings. For example, Skycure (Citation: Skycure-Profiles) describes the ability to redirect network traffic by installing a malicious iOS Configuration Profile.

If applications encrypt their network traffic, sensitive data may not be accessible to an adversary, depending on the point of capture.</p><font color=blue><p>This object has been revoked by [T1638] Adversary-in-the-Middle</p></font><p><b>Description for [T1638] Adversary-in-the-Middle</b>: Adversaries may attempt to position themselves between two or more networked devices to support follow-on behaviors such as [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002) or [Endpoint Denial of Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1642).  

 

[Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1638) can be achieved through several mechanisms, such as a malicious application registering itself as a VPN client.

Additionally, on iOS, the application requires a special entitlement that must be granted by Apple. Alternatively, if an application is able to escalate privileges, it can potentially utilize those privileges to gain access to network traffic.  

 

Outside of a mobile device, adversaries may be able to capture traffic by employing a rogue base station or Wi-Fi access point. These devices will allow adversaries to capture network traffic after it has left the device, while it is flowing to its destination. On a local network, enterprise techniques could be used, such as DNS redirection or DNS poisoning.  

 

If applications properly encrypt their network traffic, sensitive data may not be accessible an adversary, depending on the point of capture. </p><details><summary>Details</summary><table

Additionally, on iOS, the application requires a special entitlement that must be granted by Apple. Alternatively, if an application is able to escalate privileges, it can potentially utilize those privileges to gain access to network traffic.  

 

Outside of a mobile device, adversaries may be able to capture traffic by employing a rogue base station or Wi-Fi access point. These devices will allow adversaries to capture network traffic after it has left the device, while it is flowing to its destination. On a local network, enterprise techniques could be used, such as DNS redirection or DNS poisoning.  

 

If applications properly encrypt their network traffic, sensitive data may not be accessible an adversary, depending on the point of capture. </p><details><summary>Details</summary><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>dictionary_item_added</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_attack_spec_version</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2.1.0</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_deprecated</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>False</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_detection</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_domains</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>['mobile-attack']</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_is_subtechnique</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>False</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_modified_by_ref</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>identity--c78cb6e5-0c4b-4611-8297-d1b8b55e40b5</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Alex Drozhzhin.

Beginning in Android 10, changes were introduced to inhibit malicious applications’ ability to hide their icon. If an app is a system app, requests no permissions, or does not have a launcher activity, the application’s icon will be fully hidden. Further, if the device is fully managed or the application is in a work profile, the icon will be fully hidden. Otherwise, a synthesized activity is shown, which is a launcher icon that represents the app’s details page in the system settings. If the user clicks the synthesized activity in the launcher, they are taken to the application’s details page in the system settings.(Citation: Android 10 Limitations to Hiding App Icons)(Citation: LauncherApps getActivityList)</p><details><summary>Details</summary><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>dictionary_item_added</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_attack_spec_version</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2.1.0</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_deprecated</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>False</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_domains</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>['mobile-attack']</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_modified_by_ref</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>identity--c78cb6e5-0c4b-4611-8297-d1b8b55e40b5</td></tr></tbody></table><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>dictionary_item_removed</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_contributors</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>['Emily Ratliff, IBM']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td></tr></tbody></table><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>values_changed</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>modified</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2019-11-14 18:03:26.460000+00:00</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2022-03-30 20:07:33.279000+00:00</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>revoked</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>False</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>True</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[0]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-mobile-attack</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-attack</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[1]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>android-trojan-steals-paypal-2fa</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>sunny-stolen-credentials</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[1]['description']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Lukáš Štefanko.

Mobile devices often are configured to allow application installation only from an authorized app store (e.g., Google Play Store or Apple App Store). An adversary may seek to place a malicious application in an authorized app store, enabling the application to be installed onto targeted devices.

App stores typically require developer registration and use vetting techniques to identify malicious applications. Adversaries may use these techniques against app store defenses:

* [Download New Code at Runtime](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1407)
* [Obfuscated Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1406)

Adversaries may also seek to evade vetting by placing code in a malicious application to detect whether it is running in an app analysis environment and, if so, avoid performing malicious actions while under analysis. (Citation: Petsas) (Citation: Oberheide-Bouncer) (Citation: Percoco-Bouncer) (Citation: Wang)

Adversaries may also use fake identities, payment cards, etc., to create developer accounts to publish malicious applications to app stores. (Citation: Oberheide-Bouncer)

Adversaries may also use control of a target's Google account to use the Google Play Store's remote installation capability to install apps onto the Android devices associated with the Google account. (Citation: Oberheide-RemoteInstall) (Citation: Konoth) (Only applications that are available for download through the Google Play Store can be remotely installed using this technique.)</p><details><summary>Details</summary><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>dictionary_item_added</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_attack_spec_version</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2.1.0</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_deprecated</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>True</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_domains</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>['mobile-attack']</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_is_subtechnique</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>False</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_modified_by_ref</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>identity--c78cb6e5-0c4b-4611-8297-d1b8b55e40b5</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Jon Oberheide and Charlie Miller.

version</b>: 1.2</p><p><b>Description</b>: Malicious applications are a common attack vector used by adversaries to gain a presence on mobile devices. This technique describes installing a malicious application on targeted mobile devices without involving an authorized app store (e.g., Google Play Store or Apple App Store). Adversaries may wish to avoid placing malicious applications in an authorized app store due to increased potential risk of detection or other reasons. However, mobile devices often are configured to allow application installation only from an authorized app store which would prevent this technique from working.

Delivery methods for the malicious application include:

* [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001) - Including the mobile app package as an attachment to an email message.
* [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002) - Including a link to the mobile app package within an email, text message (e.g. SMS, iMessage, Hangouts, WhatsApp, etc.), web site, QR code, or other means.
* Third-Party App Store - Installed from a third-party app store (as opposed to an authorized app store that the device implicitly trusts as part of its default behavior), which may not apply the same level of scrutiny to apps as applied by an authorized app store.(Citation: IBTimes-ThirdParty)(Citation: TrendMicro-RootingMalware)(Citation: TrendMicro-FlappyBird)

This can be done in two different ways: by embedding the malware in a legitimate application, or by pretending to be a legitimate application.

Embedding the malware in a legitimate application is done by downloading the application, disassembling it, adding the malicious code, and then re-assembling it.(Citation: Zhou) The app would appear to be the original app, but would contain additional malicious functionality. The adversary could then publish the malicious application to app stores or use another delivery method.

Pretending to be a legitimate application relies heavily on lack of scrutinization by the user. Typically, a malicious app pretending to be a legitimate one will have many similar details as the legitimate one, such as name, icon, and description.(Citation: Palo Alto HenBox)

Malicious applications may also masquerade as legitimate applications when requesting access to the accessibility service in order to appear as legitimate to the user, increasing the likelihood that the access will be granted.</p><details><summary>Details</summary><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>dictionary_item_added</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_attack_spec_version</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2.1.0</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_deprecated</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>True</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_domains</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>['mobile-attack']</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_modified_by_ref</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>identity--c78cb6e5-0c4b-4611-8297-d1b8b55e40b5</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>A.

Enterprises can inspect applications themselves or use a third-party service.

Enterprises may impose policies to only allow pre-approved applications to be installed on their devices or may impose policies to block use of specific applications known to have issues. In Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) environments, enterprises may only be able to impose these policies over an enterprise-managed portion of the device.

Application Vetting is not a complete mitigation.
