<h2>Techniques</h2><h3>enterprise-attack</h3><details><summary>New Techniques</summary><hr><h4>[T1070.008] Indicator Removal: Clear Mailbox Data</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may modify mail application data to remove evidence of their activity. Email applications allow users and other programs to export and delete mailbox data via command line tools or use of APIs. Mail application data can be emails or logs generated by the application or operating system, such as export requests. 

Adversaries may manipulate email mailbox data to remove logs and artifacts, such as evidence of [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566)/[Internal Spearphishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1534), [Email Collection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1114), [Mail Protocols](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/003) for command and control, or email-based exfiltration such as [Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1048). For example, to remove evidence on Exchange servers adversaries have used the <code>ExchangePowerShell</code> [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) module, including <code>Remove-MailboxExportRequest</code> to remove evidence of mailbox exports.(Citation: Volexity SolarWinds)(Citation: ExchangePowerShell Module) On Linux and macOS, adversaries may also delete emails through a command line utility called <code>mail</code>  or use [AppleScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002) to interact with APIs on macOS.(Citation: Cybereason Cobalt Kitty 2017)(Citation: mailx man page)</p><hr><h4>[T1070.007] Indicator Removal: Clear Network Connection History and Configurations</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may clear or remove evidence of malicious network connections in order to clean up traces of their operations. Configuration settings as well as various artifacts that highlight connection history may be created on a system from behaviors that require network connections, such as [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021) or [External Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133). Defenders may use these artifacts to monitor or otherwise analyze network connections created by adversaries.

Network connection history may be stored in various locations on a system. For example, RDP connection history may be stored in Windows Registry values under (Citation: Microsoft RDP Removal):

* <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Default</code>
* <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Servers</code>

Windows may also store information about recent RDP connections in files such as <code>C:\Users\\%username%\Documents\Default.rdp</code> and `C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Terminal
Server Client\Cache\`.(Citation: Moran RDPieces) Similarly, macOS and Linux hosts may store information highlighting connection history in system logs (such as those stored in `/Library/Logs` and/or `/var/log/`).(Citation: Apple Culprit Access)(Citation: FreeDesktop Journal)(Citation: Apple Unified Log Analysis Remote Login and Screen Sharing)

Malicious network connections may also require changes to network configuration settings, such as [Disable or Modify System Firewall](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/004) or tampering to enable [Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090). Adversaries may delete or modify this data to conceal indicators and/or impede defensive analysis.</p><hr><h4>[T1070.009] Indicator Removal: Clear Persistence</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may clear artifacts associated with previously established persistence on a host system to remove evidence of their activity. This may involve various actions, such as removing services, deleting executables, [Modify Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112), [Plist File Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1647), or other methods of cleanup to prevent defenders from collecting evidence of their persistent presence.(Citation: Cylance Dust Storm)

In some instances, artifacts of persistence may also be removed once an adversary’s persistence is executed in order to prevent errors with the new instance of the malware.(Citation: NCC Group Team9 June 2020)</p><hr><h4>[T1586.003] Compromise Accounts: Cloud Accounts</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may compromise cloud accounts that can be used during targeting. Adversaries can use compromised cloud accounts to further their operations, including leveraging cloud storage services such as Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, or AWS S3 buckets for [Exfiltration to Cloud Storage](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/002) or to [Upload Tool](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/002)s. Cloud accounts can also be used in the acquisition of infrastructure, such as [Virtual Private Server](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/003)s or [Serverless](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/007) infrastructure. Compromising cloud accounts may allow adversaries to develop sophisticated capabilities without managing their own servers.(Citation: Awake Security C2 Cloud)

A variety of methods exist for compromising cloud accounts, such as gathering credentials via [Phishing for Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598), purchasing credentials from third-party sites, conducting [Password Spraying](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/003) attacks, or attempting to [Steal Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528)s.(Citation: MSTIC Nobelium Oct 2021) Prior to compromising cloud accounts, adversaries may conduct Reconnaissance to inform decisions about which accounts to compromise to further their operation. In some cases, adversaries may target privileged service provider accounts with the intent of leveraging a [Trusted Relationship](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1199) between service providers and their customers.(Citation: MSTIC Nobelium Oct 2021)</p><hr><h4>[T1585.003] Establish Accounts: Cloud Accounts</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may create accounts with cloud providers that can be used during targeting. Adversaries can use cloud accounts to further their operations, including leveraging cloud storage services such as Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, or AWS S3 buckets for [Exfiltration to Cloud Storage](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/002) or to [Upload Tool](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/002)s. Cloud accounts can also be used in the acquisition of infrastructure, such as [Virtual Private Server](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/003)s or [Serverless](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/007) infrastructure. Establishing cloud accounts may allow adversaries to develop sophisticated capabilities without managing their own servers.(Citation: Awake Security C2 Cloud)

Creating [Cloud Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1585/003) may also require adversaries to establish [Email Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1585/002) to register with the cloud provider. </p><hr><h4>[T1593.003] Search Open Websites/Domains: Code Repositories</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may search public code repositories for information about victims that can be used during targeting. Victims may store code in repositories on various third-party websites such as GitHub, GitLab, SourceForge, and BitBucket. Users typically interact with code repositories through a web application or command-line utilities such as git.  

Adversaries may search various public code repositories for various information about a victim. Public code repositories can often be a source of various general information about victims, such as commonly used programming languages and libraries as well as the names of employees. Adversaries may also identify more sensitive data, including accidentally leaked credentials or API keys.(Citation: GitHub Cloud Service Credentials) Information from these sources may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Phishing for Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598)), establishing operational resources (ex: [Compromise Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1586) or [Compromise Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584)), and/or initial access (ex: [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) or [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566)). 

**Note:** This is distinct from [Code Repositories](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213/003), which focuses on [Collection](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0009) from private and internally hosted code repositories. </p><hr><h4>[T1027.007] Obfuscated Files or Information: Dynamic API Resolution</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may obfuscate then dynamically resolve API functions called by their malware in order to conceal malicious functionalities and impair defensive analysis. Malware commonly uses various [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) functions provided by the OS to perform various tasks such as those involving processes, files, and other system artifacts.

API functions called by malware may leave static artifacts such as strings in payload files. Defensive analysts may also uncover which functions a binary file may execute via an import address table (IAT) or other structures that help dynamically link calling code to the shared modules that provide functions.(Citation: Huntress API Hash)(Citation: IRED API Hashing)

To avoid static or other defensive analysis, adversaries may use dynamic API resolution to conceal malware characteristics and functionalities. Similar to [Software Packing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/002), dynamic API resolution may change file signatures and obfuscate malicious API function calls until they are resolved and invoked during runtime.

Various methods may be used to obfuscate malware calls to API functions. For example, hashes of function names are commonly stored in malware in lieu of literal strings. Malware can use these hashes (or other identifiers) to manually reproduce the linking and loading process using functions such as `GetProcAddress()` and `LoadLibrary()`. These hashes/identifiers can also be further obfuscated using encryption or other string manipulation tricks (requiring various forms of [Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140) during execution).(Citation: BlackHat API Packers)(Citation: Drakonia HInvoke)(Citation: Huntress API Hash)</p><hr><h4>[T1027.009] Obfuscated Files or Information: Embedded Payloads</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may embed payloads within other files to conceal malicious content from defenses. Otherwise seemingly benign files (such as scripts and executables) may be abused to carry and obfuscate malicious payloads and content. In some cases, embedded payloads may also enable adversaries to [Subvert Trust Controls](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553) by not impacting execution controls such as digital signatures and notarization tickets.(Citation: Sentinel Labs) 

Adversaries may embed payloads in various file formats to hide payloads.(Citation: Microsoft Learn) This is similar to [Steganography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/003), though does not involve weaving malicious content into specific bytes and patterns related to legitimate digital media formats.(Citation: GitHub PSImage) 

For example, adversaries have been observed embedding payloads within or as an overlay of an otherwise benign binary.(Citation: Securelist Dtrack2) Adversaries have also been observed nesting payloads (such as executables and run-only scripts) inside a file of the same format.(Citation: SentinelLabs reversing run-only applescripts 2021) 

Embedded content may also be used as [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055) payloads used to infect benign system processes.(Citation: Trend Micro) These embedded then injected payloads may be used as part of the modules of malware designed to provide specific features such as encrypting C2 communications in support of an orchestrator module. For example, an embedded module may be injected into default browsers, allowing adversaries to then communicate via the network.(Citation: Malware Analysis Report ComRAT)</p><hr><h4>[T1556.007] Modify Authentication Process: Hybrid Identity</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may patch, modify, or otherwise backdoor cloud authentication processes that are tied to on-premises user identities in order to bypass typical authentication mechanisms, access credentials, and enable persistent access to accounts.  

Many organizations maintain hybrid user and device identities that are shared between on-premises and cloud-based environments. These can be maintained in a number of ways. For example, Azure AD includes three options for synchronizing identities between Active Directory and Azure AD(Citation: Azure AD Hybrid Identity):

* Password Hash Synchronization (PHS), in which a privileged on-premises account synchronizes user password hashes between Active Directory and Azure AD, allowing authentication to Azure AD to take place entirely in the cloud 
* Pass Through Authentication (PTA), in which Azure AD authentication attempts are forwarded to an on-premises PTA agent, which validates the credentials against Active Directory 
* Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), in which a trust relationship is established between Active Directory and Azure AD 

AD FS can also be used with other SaaS and cloud platforms such as AWS and GCP, which will hand off the authentication process to AD FS and receive a token containing the hybrid users’ identity and privileges. 

By modifying authentication processes tied to hybrid identities, an adversary may be able to establish persistent privileged access to cloud resources. For example, adversaries who compromise an on-premises server running a PTA agent may inject a malicious DLL into the `AzureADConnectAuthenticationAgentService` process that authorizes all attempts to authenticate to Azure AD, as well as records user credentials.(Citation: Azure AD Connect for Read Teamers)(Citation: AADInternals Azure AD On-Prem to Cloud) In environments using AD FS, an adversary may edit the `Microsoft.IdentityServer.Servicehost` configuration file to load a malicious DLL that generates authentication tokens for any user with any set of claims, thereby bypassing multi-factor authentication and defined AD FS policies.(Citation: MagicWeb)

In some cases, adversaries may be able to modify the hybrid identity authentication process from the cloud. For example, adversaries who compromise a Global Administrator account in an Azure AD tenant may be able to register a new PTA agent via the web console, similarly allowing them to harvest credentials and log into the Azure AD environment as any user.(Citation: Mandiant Azure AD Backdoors)</p><hr><h4>[T1546.016] Event Triggered Execution: Installer Packages</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may establish persistence and elevate privileges by using an installer to trigger the execution of malicious content. Installer packages are OS specific and contain the resources an operating system needs to install applications on a system. Installer packages can include scripts that run prior to installation as well as after installation is complete. Installer scripts may inherit elevated permissions when executed. Developers often use these scripts to prepare the environment for installation, check requirements, download dependencies, and remove files after installation.(Citation: Installer Package Scripting Rich Trouton)

Using legitimate applications, adversaries have distributed applications with modified installer scripts to execute malicious content. When a user installs the application, they may be required to grant administrative permissions to allow the installation. At the end of the installation process of the legitimate application, content such as macOS `postinstall` scripts can be executed with the inherited elevated permissions. Adversaries can use these scripts to execute a malicious executable or install other malicious components (such as a [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004)) with the elevated permissions.(Citation: Application Bundle Manipulation Brandon Dalton)(Citation: wardle evilquest parti)

Depending on the distribution, Linux versions of package installer scripts are sometimes called maintainer scripts or post installation scripts. These scripts can include `preinst`, `postinst`, `prerm`, `postrm` scripts and run as root when executed.

For Windows, the Microsoft Installer services uses `.msi` files to manage the installing, updating, and uninstalling of applications. Adversaries have leveraged `Prebuild` and `Postbuild` events to run commands before or after a build when installing .msi files.(Citation: Windows AppleJeus GReAT)(Citation: Debian Manual Maintainer Scripts)</p><hr><h4>[T1556.006] Modify Authentication Process: Multi-Factor Authentication</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may disable or modify multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms to enable persistent access to compromised accounts.

Once adversaries have gained access to a network by either compromising an account lacking MFA or by employing an MFA bypass method such as [Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1621), adversaries may leverage their access to modify or completely disable MFA defenses. This can be accomplished by abusing legitimate features, such as excluding users from Azure AD Conditional Access Policies, registering a new yet vulnerable/adversary-controlled MFA method, or by manually patching MFA programs and configuration files to bypass expected functionality.(Citation: Mandiant APT42)(Citation: Azure AD Conditional Access Exclusions)

For example, modifying the Windows hosts file (`C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`) to redirect MFA calls to localhost instead of an MFA server may cause the MFA process to fail. If a "fail open" policy is in place, any otherwise successful authentication attempt may be granted access without enforcing MFA. (Citation: Russians Exploit Default MFA Protocol - CISA March 2022) 

Depending on the scope, goals, and privileges of the adversary, MFA defenses may be disabled for individual accounts or for all accounts tied to a larger group, such as all domain accounts in a victim's network environment.(Citation: Russians Exploit Default MFA Protocol - CISA March 2022) </p><hr><h4>[T1608.006] Stage Capabilities: SEO Poisoning</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may poison mechanisms that influence search engine optimization (SEO) to further lure staged capabilities towards potential victims. Search engines typically display results to users based on purchased ads as well as the site’s ranking/score/reputation calculated by their web crawlers and algorithms.(Citation: Atlas SEO)(Citation: MalwareBytes SEO)

To help facilitate [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189), adversaries may stage content that explicitly manipulates SEO rankings in order to promote sites hosting their malicious payloads (such as [Drive-by Target](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/004)) within search engines. Poisoning SEO rankings may involve various tricks, such as stuffing keywords (including in the form of hidden text) into compromised sites. These keywords could be related to the interests/browsing habits of the intended victim(s) as well as more broad, seasonably popular topics (e.g. elections, trending news).(Citation: ZScaler SEO)(Citation: Atlas SEO)

Adversaries may also purchase or plant incoming links to staged capabilities in order to boost the site’s calculated relevance and reputation.(Citation: MalwareBytes SEO)(Citation: DFIR Report Gootloader)

SEO poisoning may also be combined with evasive redirects and other cloaking mechanisms (such as measuring mouse movements or serving content based on browser user agents, user language/localization settings, or HTTP headers) in order to feed SEO inputs while avoiding scrutiny from defenders.(Citation: ZScaler SEO)(Citation: Sophos Gootloader)</p><hr><h4>[T1584.007] Compromise Infrastructure: Serverless</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may compromise serverless cloud infrastructure, such as Cloudflare Workers or AWS Lambda functions, that can be used during targeting. By utilizing serverless infrastructure, adversaries can make it more difficult to attribute infrastructure used during operations back to them. 

Once compromised, the serverless runtime environment can be leveraged to either respond directly to infected machines or to [Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090) traffic to an adversary-owned command and control server.(Citation: BlackWater Malware Cloudflare Workers)(Citation: AWS Lambda Redirector) As traffic generated by these functions will appear to come from subdomains of common cloud providers, it may be difficult to distinguish from ordinary traffic to these providers.(Citation: Detecting Command & Control in the Cloud)(Citation: BlackWater Malware Cloudflare Workers)</p><hr><h4>[T1583.007] Acquire Infrastructure: Serverless</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may purchase and configure serverless cloud infrastructure, such as Cloudflare Workers or AWS Lambda functions, that can be used during targeting. By utilizing serverless infrastructure, adversaries can make it more difficult to attribute infrastructure used during operations back to them.

Once acquired, the serverless runtime environment can be leveraged to either respond directly to infected machines or to [Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090) traffic to an adversary-owned command and control server.(Citation: BlackWater Malware Cloudflare Workers)(Citation: AWS Lambda Redirector) As traffic generated by these functions will appear to come from subdomains of common cloud providers, it may be difficult to distinguish from ordinary traffic to these providers.(Citation: Detecting Command & Control in the Cloud)(Citation: BlackWater Malware Cloudflare Workers)</p><hr><h4>[T1648] Serverless Execution</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may abuse serverless computing, integration, and automation services to execute arbitrary code in cloud environments. Many cloud providers offer a variety of serverless resources, including compute engines, application integration services, and web servers. 

Adversaries may abuse these resources in various ways as a means of executing arbitrary commands. For example, adversaries may use serverless functions to execute malicious code, such as crypto-mining malware (i.e. [Resource Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1496)).(Citation: Cado Security Denonia) Adversaries may also create functions that enable further compromise of the cloud environment. For example, an adversary may use the `IAM:PassRole` permission in AWS or the `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` permission in Google Cloud to add [Additional Cloud Roles](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/003) to a serverless cloud function, which may then be able to perform actions the original user cannot.(Citation: Rhino Security Labs AWS Privilege Escalation)(Citation: Rhingo Security Labs GCP Privilege Escalation)

Serverless functions can also be invoked in response to cloud events (i.e. [Event Triggered Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546)), potentially enabling persistent execution over time. For example, in AWS environments, an adversary may create a Lambda function that automatically adds [Additional Cloud Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/001) to a user and a corresponding CloudWatch events rule that invokes that function whenever a new user is created.(Citation: Backdooring an AWS account) Similarly, an adversary may create a Power Automate workflow in Office 365 environments that forwards all emails a user receives or creates anonymous sharing links whenever a user is granted access to a document in SharePoint.(Citation: Varonis Power Automate Data Exfiltration)(Citation: Microsoft DART Case Report 001)</p><hr><h4>[T1205.002] Traffic Signaling: Socket Filters</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may attach filters to a network socket to monitor then activate backdoors used for persistence or command and control. With elevated permissions, adversaries can use features such as the `libpcap` library to open sockets and install filters to allow or disallow certain types of data to come through the socket. The filter may apply to all traffic passing through the specified network interface (or every interface if not specified). When the network interface receives a packet matching the filter criteria, additional actions can be triggered on the host, such as activation of a reverse shell.

To establish a connection, an adversary sends a crafted packet to the targeted host that matches the installed filter criteria.(Citation: haking9 libpcap network sniffing) Adversaries have used these socket filters to trigger the installation of implants, conduct ping backs, and to invoke command shells. Communication with these socket filters may also be used in conjunction with [Protocol Tunneling](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1572).(Citation: exatrack bpf filters passive backdoors)(Citation: Leonardo Turla Penquin May 2020)

Filters can be installed on any Unix-like platform with `libpcap` installed or on Windows hosts using `Winpcap`.  Adversaries may use either `libpcap` with `pcap_setfilter` or the standard library function `setsockopt` with `SO_ATTACH_FILTER` options. Since the socket connection is not active until the packet is received, this behavior may be difficult to detect due to the lack of activity on a host, low CPU overhead, and limited visibility into raw socket usage.</p><hr><h4>[T1649] Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may steal or forge certificates used for authentication to access remote systems or resources. Digital certificates are often used to sign and encrypt messages and/or files. Certificates are also used as authentication material. For example, Azure AD device certificates and Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) certificates bind to an identity and can be used as credentials for domain accounts.(Citation: O365 Blog Azure AD Device IDs)(Citation: Microsoft AD CS Overview)

Authentication certificates can be both stolen and forged. For example, AD CS certificates can be stolen from encrypted storage (in the Registry or files), misplaced certificate files (i.e. [Unsecured Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552)), or directly from the Windows certificate store via various crypto APIs.(Citation: SpecterOps Certified Pre Owned)(Citation: GitHub CertStealer)(Citation: GitHub GhostPack Certificates) With appropriate enrollment rights, users and/or machines within a domain can also request and/or manually renew certificates from enterprise certificate authorities (CA). This enrollment process defines various settings and permissions associated with the certificate. Of note, the certificate’s extended key usage (EKU) values define signing, encryption, and authentication use cases, while the certificate’s subject alternative name (SAN) values define the certificate owner’s alternate names.(Citation: Medium Certified Pre Owned)

Abusing certificates for authentication credentials may enable other behaviors such as [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008). Certificate-related misconfigurations may also enable opportunities for [Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004), by way of allowing users to impersonate or assume privileged accounts or permissions via the identities (SANs) associated with a certificate. These abuses may also enable [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003) via stealing or forging certificates that can be used as [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) for the duration of the certificate's validity, despite user password resets. Authentication certificates can also be stolen and forged for machine accounts.

Adversaries who have access to root (or subordinate) CA certificate private keys (or mechanisms protecting/managing these keys) may also establish [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003) by forging arbitrary authentication certificates for the victim domain (known as “golden” certificates).(Citation: Medium Certified Pre Owned) Adversaries may also target certificates and related services in order to access other forms of credentials, such as [Golden Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/001) ticket-granting tickets (TGT) or NTLM plaintext.(Citation: Medium Certified Pre Owned)</p><hr><h4>[T1027.008] Obfuscated Files or Information: Stripped Payloads</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: Adversaries may attempt to make a payload difficult to analyze by removing symbols, strings, and other human readable information. Scripts and executables may contain variables names and other strings that help developers document code functionality. Symbols are often created by an operating system’s `linker` when executable payloads are compiled. Reverse engineers use these symbols and strings to analyze code and to identify functionality in payloads.(Citation: Mandiant golang stripped binaries explanation)(Citation: intezer stripped binaries elf files 2018)

Adversaries may use stripped payloads in order to make malware analysis more difficult. For example, compilers and other tools may provide features to remove or obfuscate strings and symbols. Adversaries have also used stripped payload formats, such as run-only AppleScripts, a compiled and stripped version of [AppleScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002), to evade detection and analysis. The lack of human-readable information may directly hinder detection and analysis of payloads.(Citation: SentinelLabs reversing run-only applescripts 2021)</p></details><details><summary>Major Version Changes</summary><hr><h4>[T1530] Data from Cloud Storage</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 2.0</p><p><b>Version changed from</b>: 1.1 → 2.0</p>

Various command interpreters keep track of the commands users type in their terminal so that users can retrace what they've done.

On Linux and macOS, these command histories can be accessed in a few different ways. While logged in, this command history is tracked in a file pointed to by the environment variable <code>HISTFILE</code>. When a user logs off a system, this information is flushed to a file in the user's home directory called <code>~/.bash_history</code>. The benefit of this is that it allows users to go back to commands they've used before in different sessions.

Adversaries may delete their commands from these logs by manually clearing the history (<code>history -c</code>) or deleting the bash history file <code>rm ~/.bash_history</code>.  

Adversaries may also leverage a [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) on network devices to clear command history data.(Citation: US-CERT-TA18-106A)

On Windows hosts, PowerShell has two different command history providers: the built-in history and the command history managed by the <code>PSReadLine</code> module. The built-in history only tracks the commands used in the current session. This command history is not available to other sessions and is deleted when the session ends.

The <code>PSReadLine</code> command history tracks the commands used in all PowerShell sessions and writes them to a file (<code>$env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt</code> by default). This history file is available to all sessions and contains all past history since the file is not deleted when the session ends.(Citation: Microsoft PowerShell Command History)

Adversaries may run the PowerShell command <code>Clear-History</code> to flush the entire command history from a current PowerShell session. This, however, will not delete/flush the <code>ConsoleHost_history.txt</code> file. Adversaries may also delete the <code>ConsoleHost_history.txt</code> file or edit its contents to hide PowerShell commands they have run.(Citation: Sophos PowerShell command audit)(Citation: Sophos PowerShell Command History Forensics)</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>In addition to clearing system logs, an adversary may clear the command history of a compromised account to conceal the actions undertaken during an intrusion.

By achieving the adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) position, adversaries may collect network communications, including passed credentials, especially those sent over insecure, unencrypted protocols. This may also enable follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040) or [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002).

DHCP is based on a client-server model and has two functionalities: a protocol for providing network configuration settings from a DHCP server to a client and a mechanism for allocating network addresses to clients.(Citation: rfc2131) The typical server-client interaction is as follows: 

1. The client broadcasts a `DISCOVER` message.

2. The server responds with an `OFFER` message, which includes an available network address. 

3. The client broadcasts a `REQUEST` message, which includes the network address offered. 

4. The server acknowledges with an `ACK` message and the client receives the network configuration parameters.

Adversaries may spoof as a rogue DHCP server on the victim network, from which legitimate hosts may receive malicious network configurations. For example, malware can act as a DHCP server and provide adversary-owned DNS servers to the victimized computers.(Citation: new_rogue_DHCP_serv_malware)(Citation: w32.tidserv.g) Through the malicious network configurations, an adversary may achieve the AiTM position, route client traffic through adversary-controlled systems, and collect information from the client network.

Rather than establishing an AiTM position, adversaries may also abuse DHCP spoofing to perform a DHCP exhaustion attack (i.e. [Service Exhaustion Flood](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/002)) by generating many broadcast DISCOVER messages to exhaust a network’s DHCP allocation pool. </td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Adversaries may redirect network traffic to adversary-owned systems by spoofing Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) traffic and acting as a malicious DHCP server on the victim network.

DHCPv6 clients can receive network configuration information without being assigned an IP address by sending a <code>INFORMATION-REQUEST (code 11)</code> message to the <code>All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers</code> multicast address.(Citation: rfc3315) Adversaries may use their rogue DHCP server to respond to this request message with malicious network configurations.

Rather than establishing an AiTM position, adversaries may also abuse DHCP spoofing to perform a DHCP exhaustion attack (i.e, [Service Exhaustion Flood](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/002)) by generating many broadcast DISCOVER messages to exhaust a network’s DHCP allocation pool. </td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[3]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>dhcp_serv_op_events</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>rfc3315</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[3]['description']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Microsoft.

Adversaries may also tamper with artifacts deployed and utilized by security tools. Security tools may make dynamic changes to system components in order to maintain visibility into specific events. For example, security products may load their own modules and/or modify those loaded by processes to facilitate data collection.

In cloud environments, tools disabled by adversaries may include cloud monitoring agents that report back to services such as AWS CloudWatch or Google Cloud Monitor.

Furthermore, although defensive tools may have anti-tampering mechanisms, adversaries may abuse tools such as legitimate rootkit removal kits to impair and/or disable these tools.(Citation: chasing_avaddon_ransomware)(Citation: dharma_ransomware)(Citation: demystifying_ryuk)(Citation: doppelpaymer_crowdstrike) For example, adversaries have used tools such as GMER to find and shut down hidden processes and antivirus software on infected systems.(Citation: demystifying_ryuk)

Additionally, adversaries may exploit legitimate drivers from anti-virus software to gain access to kernel space (i.e. [Exploitation for Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068)), which may lead to bypassing anti-tampering features.(Citation: avoslocker_ransomware)</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[1]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>capec</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>OutFlank System Calls</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[1]['url']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/578.html</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>https://outflank.nl/blog/2019/06/19/red-team-tactics-combining-direct-system-calls-and-srdi-to-bypass-av-edr/</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[2]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>OutFlank System Calls</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>chasing_avaddon_ransomware</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[2]['description']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>de Plaa, C.

DLL injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.  

DLL injection is commonly performed by writing the path to a DLL in the virtual address space of the target process before loading the DLL by invoking a new thread. The write can be performed with native Windows API calls such as <code>VirtualAllocEx</code> and <code>WriteProcessMemory</code>, then invoked with <code>CreateRemoteThread</code> (which calls the <code>LoadLibrary</code> API responsible for loading the DLL). (Citation: Elastic Process Injection July 2017) 

Variations of this method such as reflective DLL injection (writing a self-mapping DLL into a process) and memory module (map DLL when writing into process) overcome the address relocation issue as well as the additional APIs to invoke execution (since these methods load and execute the files in memory by manually preforming the function of <code>LoadLibrary</code>).(Citation: Elastic HuntingNMemory June 2017)(Citation: Elastic Process Injection July 2017) 

Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via DLL injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. </td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Adversaries may inject dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.

Another variation of this method, often referred to as Module Stomping/Overloading or DLL Hollowing, may be leveraged to conceal injected code within a process. This method involves loading a legitimate DLL into a remote process then manually overwriting the module's <code>AddressOfEntryPoint</code> before starting a new thread in the target process.(Citation: Module Stomping for Shellcode Injection) This variation allows attackers to hide malicious injected code by potentially backing its execution with a legitimate DLL file on disk.(Citation: Hiding Malicious Code with Module Stomping) 

Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via DLL injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. </td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[1]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Elastic Process Injection July 2017</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Hiding Malicious Code with Module Stomping</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[1]['description']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Hosseini, A.

Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Search Open Websites/Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1593) or [Phishing for Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598)), establishing operational resources (ex: [Email Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1586/002)), and/or initial access (ex: [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) or [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110) via [External Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133)).</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[1]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>HackersArise Email</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Azure Active Directory Reconnaisance</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[1]['description']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Hackers Arise.

Examples include creating a container configured to mount the host’s filesystem using the bind parameter, which allows the adversary to drop payloads and execute control utilities such as cron on the host; utilizing a privileged container to run commands or load a malicious kernel module on the underlying host; or abusing system calls such as `unshare` and `keyctl` to escalate privileges and steal secrets.(Citation: Docker Bind Mounts)(Citation: Trend Micro Privileged Container)(Citation: Intezer Doki July 20)(Citation: Container Escape)(Citation: Crowdstrike Kubernetes Container Escape)(Citation: Keyctl-unmask)

When documents, applications, or programs are downloaded an extended attribute (xattr) called <code>com.apple.quarantine</code> can be set on the file by the application performing the download. This attribute, also known as a quarantine flag, is read by Apple's Gatekeeper defense program when the file is run and provides a prompt to the user to allow or deny execution. Gatekeeper also monitors an application's usage of dynamic libraries (dylibs) loaded outside the application folder on any quarantined binary, often using the <code>dlopen</code> function. If the quarantine flag is set in macOS 10.15+, Gatekeeper also checks for a notarization ticket and sends a cryptographic hash to Apple's servers to check for validity for all unsigned executables.(Citation: TheEclecticLightCompany apple notarization )(Citation: Bypassing Gatekeeper)

The quarantine flag is an opt-in system and not imposed by macOS. If an application opts-in, a file downloaded from the Internet will be given a quarantine flag before being saved to disk. Any application or user with write permissions to the file can change or strip the quarantine flag. With elevated permission (sudo), this attribute can be removed from any file. The presence of the <code>com.apple.quarantine</code> quarantine flag can be checked with the xattr command <code>xattr -l /path/to/examplefile</code>. Similarly, this attribute can be recursively removed from all files in a folder using xattr, <code>sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/folder</code>.(Citation: 20 macOS Common Tools and Techniques)(Citation: TheEclecticLightCompany Quarantine and the flag)(Citation: theevilbit gatekeeper bypass 2021)

Apps and files loaded onto the system from a USB flash drive, optical disk, external hard drive, from a drive shared over the local network, or using the <code>curl</code> command do not set this flag. Additionally, it is possible to avoid setting this flag using [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189), which may bypass Gatekeeper. (Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence)(Citation: Clearing quarantine attribute)(Citation: OceanLotus for OS X)</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Adversaries may modify file attributes and subvert Gatekeeper functionality to evade user prompts and execute untrusted programs. Gatekeeper is a set of technologies that act as layer of Apple’s security model to ensure only trusted applications are executed on a host. Gatekeeper was built on top of File Quarantine in Snow Leopard (10.6, 2009) and has grown to include Code Signing, security policy compliance, Notarization, and more. Gatekeeper also treats applications running for the first time differently than reopened applications.(Citation: TheEclecticLightCompany Quarantine and the flag)(Citation: TheEclecticLightCompany apple notarization )

Based on an opt-in system, when files are downloaded an extended attribute (xattr) called `com.apple.quarantine` (also known as a quarantine flag) can be set on the file by the application performing the download. Launch Services opens the application in a suspended state. For first run applications with the quarantine flag set, Gatekeeper executes the following functions:

1. Checks extended attribute – Gatekeeper checks for the quarantine flag, then provides an alert prompt to the user to allow or deny execution.(Citation: OceanLotus for OS X)(Citation: 20 macOS Common Tools and Techniques)

2. Checks System Policies - Gatekeeper checks the system security policy, allowing execution of apps downloaded from either just the App Store or the App Store and identified developers.

3. Code Signing – Gatekeeper checks for a valid code signature from an Apple Developer ID.

4. Notarization - Using the `api.apple-cloudkit.com` API, Gatekeeper reaches out to Apple servers to verify or pull down the notarization ticket and ensure the ticket is not revoked. Users can override notarization, which will result in a prompt of executing an “unauthorized app” and the security policy will be modified.

Adversaries can subvert one or multiple security controls within Gatekeeper checks through logic errors (e.g. [Exploitation for Defense Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1211)), unchecked file types, and external libraries. For example, prior to macOS 13 Ventura, code signing and notarization checks were only conducted on first launch, allowing adversaries to write malicious executables to previously opened applications in order to bypass Gatekeeper security checks.(Citation: theevilbit gatekeeper bypass 2021)(Citation: Application Bundle Manipulation Brandon Dalton)

Applications and files loaded onto the system from a USB flash drive, optical disk, external hard drive, from a drive shared over the local network, or using the curl command may not set the quarantine flag. Additionally, it is possible to avoid setting the quarantine flag using [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189).</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[1]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>theevilbit gatekeeper bypass 2021</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Application Bundle Manipulation Brandon Dalton</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[1]['description']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Csaba Fitzl.

Various command interpreters keep track of the commands users type in their terminal so that users can retrace what they've done. 

On Linux and macOS, command history is tracked in a file pointed to by the environment variable <code>HISTFILE</code>. When a user logs off a system, this information is flushed to a file in the user's home directory called <code>~/.bash_history</code>. The <code>HISTCONTROL</code> environment variable keeps track of what should be saved by the <code>history</code> command and eventually into the <code>~/.bash_history</code> file when a user logs out. <code>HISTCONTROL</code> does not exist by default on macOS, but can be set by the user and will be respected.

Adversaries may clear the history environment variable (<code>unset HISTFILE</code>) or set the command history size to zero (<code>export HISTFILESIZE=0</code>) to prevent logging of commands. Additionally, <code>HISTCONTROL</code> can be configured to ignore commands that start with a space by simply setting it to "ignorespace". <code>HISTCONTROL</code> can also be set to ignore duplicate commands by setting it to "ignoredups". In some Linux systems, this is set by default to "ignoreboth" which covers both of the previous examples. This means that “ ls” will not be saved, but “ls” would be saved by history. Adversaries can abuse this to operate without leaving traces by simply prepending a space to all of their terminal commands. 

On Windows systems, the <code>PSReadLine</code> module tracks commands used in all PowerShell sessions and writes them to a file (<code>$env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt</code> by default). Adversaries may change where these logs are saved using <code>Set-PSReadLineOption -HistorySavePath {File Path}</code>. This will cause <code>ConsoleHost_history.txt</code> to stop receiving logs. Additionally, it is possible to turn off logging to this file using the PowerShell command <code>Set-PSReadlineOption -HistorySaveStyle SaveNothing</code>.(Citation: Microsoft PowerShell Command History)(Citation: Sophos PowerShell command audit)(Citation: Sophos PowerShell Command History Forensics)

Adversaries may also leverage a [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) on network devices to disable historical command logging.</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Adversaries may impair command history logging to hide commands they run on a compromised system.

ETW interruption can be achieved multiple ways, however most directly by defining conditions using the [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) <code>Set-EtwTraceProvider</code> cmdlet or by interfacing directly with the Registry to make alterations.

In the case of network-based reporting of indicators, an adversary may block traffic associated with reporting to prevent central analysis. This may be accomplished by many means, such as stopping a local process responsible for forwarding telemetry and/or creating a host-based firewall rule to block traffic to specific hosts responsible for aggregating events, such as security information and event management (SIEM) products. </td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>An adversary may attempt to block indicators or events typically captured by sensors from being gathered and analyzed.

This activity may be used to collect or relay authentication materials. 

Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) are Microsoft Windows components that serve as alternate methods of host identification. LLMNR is based upon the Domain Name System (DNS) format and allows hosts on the same local link to perform name resolution for other hosts. NBT-NS identifies systems on a local network by their NetBIOS name. (Citation: Wikipedia LLMNR) (Citation: TechNet NetBIOS)

Adversaries can spoof an authoritative source for name resolution on a victim network by responding to LLMNR (UDP 5355)/NBT-NS (UDP 137) traffic as if they know the identity of the requested host, effectively poisoning the service so that the victims will communicate with the adversary controlled system. If the requested host belongs to a resource that requires identification/authentication, the username and NTLMv2 hash will then be sent to the adversary controlled system. The adversary can then collect the hash information sent over the wire through tools that monitor the ports for traffic or through [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040) and crack the hashes offline through [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110) to obtain the plaintext passwords. In some cases where an adversary has access to a system that is in the authentication path between systems or when automated scans that use credentials attempt to authenticate to an adversary controlled system, the NTLMv2 hashes can be intercepted and relayed to access and execute code against a target system. The relay step can happen in conjunction with poisoning but may also be independent of it. (Citation: byt3bl33d3r NTLM Relaying)(Citation: Secure Ideas SMB Relay)

Several tools exist that can be used to poison name services within local networks such as NBNSpoof, Metasploit, and [Responder](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0174).

Payloads may be compressed, archived, or encrypted in order to avoid detection. These payloads may be used during Initial Access or later to mitigate detection.

Password policies are a way to enforce complex passwords that are difficult to guess or crack through [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110). This information may help the adversary to create a list of common passwords and launch dictionary and/or brute force attacks which adheres to the policy (e.g. if the minimum password length should be 8, then not trying passwords such as 'pass123'; not checking for more than 3-4 passwords per account if the lockout is set to 6 as to not lock out accounts).

Password policies can be set and discovered on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems via various command shell utilities such as <code>net accounts (/domain)</code>, <code>Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy</code>, <code>chage -l <username></code>, <code>cat /etc/pam.d/common-password</code>, and <code>pwpolicy getaccountpolicies</code> (Citation: Superuser Linux Password Policies) (Citation: Jamf User Password Policies).

Mobile devices may also be used to infect PCs with malware if connected via USB.(Citation: Exploiting Smartphone USB ) This infection may be achieved using devices (Android, iOS, etc.) and, in some instances, USB charging cables.(Citation: Windows Malware Infecting Android)(Citation: iPhone Charging Cable Hack) For example, when a smartphone is connected to a system, it may appear to be mounted similar to a USB-connected disk drive. If malware that is compatible with the connected system is on the mobile device, the malware could infect the machine (especially if Autorun features are enabled).</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_data_sources[0]</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>File: File Creation</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Drive: Drive Creation</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_data_sources[1]</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Process: Process Creation</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>File: File Access</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_data_sources[2]</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Drive: Drive Creation</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Process: Process Creation</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_data_sources[3]</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>File: File Access</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>File: File Creation</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_version</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>1.1</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>1.2</td></tr></tbody></table><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>iterable_item_added</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>{'source_name': 'Windows Malware Infecting Android', 'description': 'Lucian Constantin.

There are multiple ways to access the Task Scheduler in Windows. The [schtasks](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0111) utility can be run directly on the command line, or the Task Scheduler can be opened through the GUI within the Administrator Tools section of the Control Panel. In some cases, adversaries have used a .NET wrapper for the Windows Task Scheduler, and alternatively, adversaries have used the Windows netapi32 library to create a scheduled task.

The deprecated [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) utility could also be abused by adversaries (ex: [At](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/002)), though <code>at.exe</code> can not access tasks created with <code>schtasks</code> or the Control Panel.

An adversary may use Windows Task Scheduler to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence. The Windows Task Scheduler can also be abused to conduct remote Execution as part of Lateral Movement and/or to run a process under the context of a specified account (such as SYSTEM). Similar to [System Binary Proxy Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218), adversaries have also abused the Windows Task Scheduler to potentially mask one-time execution under signed/trusted system processes.(Citation: ProofPoint Serpent)</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Adversaries may abuse the Windows Task Scheduler to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code.

Adversaries may also create "hidden" scheduled tasks (i.e. [Hide Artifacts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564)) that may not be visible to defender tools and manual queries used to enumerate tasks. Specifically, an adversary may hide a task from `schtasks /query` and the Task Scheduler by deleting the associated Security Descriptor (SD) registry value (where deletion of this value must be completed using SYSTEM permissions).(Citation: SigmaHQ)(Citation: Tarrask scheduled task) Adversaries may also employ alternate methods to hide tasks, such as altering the metadata (e.g., `Index` value) within associated registry keys.(Citation: Defending Against Scheduled Task Attacks in Windows Environments) </td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[1]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>ProofPoint Serpent</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>SigmaHQ</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[1]['description']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Campbell, B. et al.

Adversaries could use shortcuts to execute their tools for persistence.

Shortcuts or symbolic links are used to reference other files or programs that will be opened or executed when the shortcut is clicked or executed by a system startup process.

Adversaries may abuse shortcuts in the startup folder to execute their tools and achieve persistence.(Citation: Shortcut for Persistence ) Although often used as payloads in an infection chain (e.g. [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001)), adversaries may also create a new shortcut as a means of indirection, while also abusing [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036) to make the malicious shortcut appear as a legitimate program. Adversaries can also edit the target path or entirely replace an existing shortcut so their malware will be executed instead of the intended legitimate program.

Shortcuts can also be abused to establish persistence by implementing other methods. For example, LNK browser extensions may be modified (e.g. [Browser Extensions](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1176)) to persistently launch malware.</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[1]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>capec</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Shortcut for Persistence </td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[1]['url']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/132.html</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/7.17/shortcut-file-written-or-modified-for-persistence.html#shortcut-file-written-or-modified-for-persistence</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_data_sources[0]</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Process: Process Creation</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>File: File Creation</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_data_sources[1]</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>File: File Creation</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Process: Process Creation</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_version</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>1.1</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>1.2</td></tr></tbody></table><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>iterable_item_added</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>{'source_name': 'capec', 'url': 'https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/132.html', 'external_id': 'CAPEC-132'}</td></tr></tbody></table></details><hr><h4>[T1598.003] Phishing for Information: Spearphishing Link</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.3</p><p><b>Version changed from</b>: 1.2 → 1.3</p>

Adversaries may also use information from previous reconnaissance efforts (ex: [Search Open Websites/Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1593) or [Search Victim-Owned Websites](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1594)) to craft persuasive and believable lures.</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[1]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>TrendMictro Phishing</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>ACSC Email Spoofing</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[1]['description']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Babon, P.

Spearphishing with a link is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of links to download malware contained in email, instead of attaching malicious files to the email itself, to avoid defenses that may inspect email attachments. Spearphishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.

All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this case, the malicious emails contain links. Generally, the links will be accompanied by social engineering text and require the user to actively click or copy and paste a URL into a browser, leveraging [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204). The visited website may compromise the web browser using an exploit, or the user will be prompted to download applications, documents, zip files, or even executables depending on the pretext for the email in the first place. Adversaries may also include links that are intended to interact directly with an email reader, including embedded images intended to exploit the end system directly or verify the receipt of an email (i.e. web bugs/web beacons). 

Adversaries may also utilize links to perform consent phishing, typically with OAuth 2.0 request URLs that when accepted by the user provide permissions/access for malicious applications, allowing adversaries to  [Steal Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528)s.(Citation: Trend Micro Pawn Storm OAuth 2017) These stolen access tokens allow the adversary to perform various actions on behalf of the user via API calls.

Additionally, adversaries may use seemingly benign links that abuse special characters to mimic legitimate websites (known as an "IDN homograph attack").(Citation: CISA IDN ST05-016)

Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access and remote desktop. Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide to make it harder to detect their presence.

In some cases, adversaries may abuse inactive accounts: for example, those belonging to individuals who are no longer part of an organization. Using these accounts may allow the adversary to evade detection, as the original account user will not be present to identify any anomalous activity taking place on their account.(Citation: CISA MFA PrintNightmare)

The overlap of permissions for local, domain, and cloud accounts across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator) to bypass access controls set within the enterprise.(Citation: TechNet Credential Theft)</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access, network devices, and remote desktop.(Citation: volexity_0day_sophos_FW) Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network.

The Credential Manager stores credentials for signing into websites, applications, and/or devices that request authentication through NTLM or Kerberos in Credential Lockers (previously known as Windows Vaults).(Citation: Microsoft Credential Manager store)(Citation: Microsoft Credential Locker)

The Windows Credential Manager separates website credentials from application or network credentials in two lockers. As part of [Credentials from Web Browsers](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/003), Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge website credentials are managed by the Credential Manager and are stored in the Web Credentials locker. Application and network credentials are stored in the Windows Credentials locker.

Credential Lockers store credentials in encrypted <code>.vcrd</code> files, located under <code>%Systemdrive%\Users\\[Username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\\[Vault/Credentials]\</code>. The encryption key can be found in a file named <code>Policy.vpol</code>, typically located in the same folder as the credentials.(Citation: passcape Windows Vault)(Citation: Malwarebytes The Windows Vault)

Adversaries may list credentials managed by the Windows Credential Manager through several mechanisms. <code>vaultcmd.exe</code> is a native Windows executable that can be used to enumerate credentials stored in the Credential Locker through a command-line interface. Adversaries may gather credentials by reading files located inside of the Credential Lockers. Adversaries may also abuse Windows APIs such as <code>CredEnumerateA</code> to list credentials managed by the Credential Manager.(Citation: Microsoft CredEnumerate)(Citation: Delpy Mimikatz Crendential Manager)

Adversaries may list credentials managed by the Windows Credential Manager through several mechanisms. <code>vaultcmd.exe</code> is a native Windows executable that can be used to enumerate credentials stored in the Credential Locker through a command-line interface. Adversaries may also gather credentials by directly reading files located inside of the Credential Lockers. Windows APIs, such as <code>CredEnumerateA</code>, may also be absued to list credentials managed by the Credential Manager.(Citation: Microsoft CredEnumerate)(Citation: Delpy Mimikatz Crendential Manager)

Adversaries may also obtain credentials from credential backups. Credential backups and restorations may be performed by running <code>rundll32.exe keymgr.dll KRShowKeyMgr</code> then selecting the “Back up...” button on the “Stored User Names and Passwords” GUI.

Password recovery tools may also obtain plain text passwords from the Credential Manager.(Citation: Malwarebytes The Windows Vault)</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_version</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>1.0</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>1.1</td></tr></tbody></table><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>iterable_item_added</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_contributors</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Uriel Kosayev</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_contributors</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Vadim Khrykov</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_data_sources</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Process: Process Creation</td></tr></tbody></table><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>iterable_item_removed</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_data_sources</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Process: Process Creation</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td></tr></tbody></table></details></details><details><summary>Patches</summary><hr><h4>[T1557.002] Adversary-in-the-Middle: ARP Cache Poisoning</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.1</p><details><summary>Details</summary><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>dictionary_item_added</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_attack_spec_version</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2.1.0</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_deprecated</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>False</td></tr></tbody></table><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>dictionary_item_removed</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_permissions_required</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>['User']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td></tr></tbody></table><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>values_changed</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>modified</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2021-07-28 01:04:39.141000+00:00</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2022-07-22 18:37:22.176000+00:00</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[1]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>RFC826 ARP</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Cylance Cleaver</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[1]['description']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Plummer, D.

AppleScript is a macOS scripting language designed to control applications and parts of the OS via inter-application messages called AppleEvents.(Citation: Apple AppleScript) These AppleEvent messages can be sent independently or easily scripted with AppleScript. These events can locate open windows, send keystrokes, and interact with almost any open application locally or remotely.

Scripts can be run from the command-line via <code>osascript /path/to/script</code> or <code>osascript -e "script here"</code>. Aside from the command line, scripts can be executed in numerous ways including Mail rules, Calendar.app alarms, and Automator workflows. AppleScripts can also be executed as plain text shell scripts by adding <code>#!/usr/bin/osascript</code> to the start of the script file.(Citation: SentinelOne AppleScript)

AppleScripts do not need to call <code>osascript</code> to execute, however. They may be executed from within mach-O binaries by using the macOS [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106)s <code>NSAppleScript</code> or <code>OSAScript</code>, both of which execute code independent of the <code>/usr/bin/osascript</code> command line utility.

Adversaries may abuse AppleScript to execute various behaviors, such as interacting with an open SSH connection, moving to remote machines, and even presenting users with fake dialog boxes. These events cannot start applications remotely (they can start them locally), but they can interact with applications if they're already running remotely. On macOS 10.10 Yosemite and higher, AppleScript has the ability to execute [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106)s, which otherwise would require compilation and execution in a mach-O binary file format.(Citation: SentinelOne macOS Red Team) Since this is a scripting language, it can be used to launch more common techniques as well such as a reverse shell via [Python](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/006).(Citation: Macro Malware Targets Macs)</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Adversaries may abuse AppleScript for execution.

After a user logs on, the system generates and stores a variety of credential materials in LSASS process memory. These credential materials can be harvested by an administrative user or SYSTEM and used to conduct [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008) using [Use Alternate Authentication Material](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550).

As well as in-memory techniques, the LSASS process memory can be dumped from the target host and analyzed on a local system.

For example, on the target host use procdump:

* <code>procdump -ma lsass.exe lsass_dump</code>

Locally, mimikatz can be run using:

* <code>sekurlsa::Minidump lsassdump.dmp</code>
* <code>sekurlsa::logonPasswords</code>

Built-in Windows tools such as comsvcs.dll can also be used:

* <code>rundll32.exe C:\Windows\System32\comsvcs.dll MiniDump PID  lsass.dmp full</code>(Citation: Volexity Exchange Marauder March 2021)(Citation: Symantec Attacks Against Government Sector)


Windows Security Support Provider (SSP) DLLs are loaded into LSSAS process at system start. Once loaded into the LSA, SSP DLLs have access to encrypted and plaintext passwords that are stored in Windows, such as any logged-on user's Domain password or smart card PINs. The SSP configuration is stored in two Registry keys: <code>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Security Packages</code> and <code>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig\Security Packages</code>. An adversary may modify these Registry keys to add new SSPs, which will be loaded the next time the system boots, or when the AddSecurityPackage Windows API function is called.(Citation: Graeber 2014)

The following SSPs can be used to access credentials:

* Msv: Interactive logons, batch logons, and service logons are done through the MSV authentication package.
* Wdigest: The Digest Authentication protocol is designed for use with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Simple Authentication Security Layer (SASL) exchanges.(Citation: TechNet Blogs Credential Protection)
* Kerberos: Preferred for mutual client-server domain authentication in Windows 2000 and later.
* CredSSP:  Provides SSO and Network Level Authentication for Remote Desktop Services.(Citation: TechNet Blogs Credential Protection)

The SAM is a database file that contains local accounts for the host, typically those found with the <code>net user</code> command. Enumerating the SAM database requires SYSTEM level access.

A number of tools can be used to retrieve the SAM file through in-memory techniques:

* pwdumpx.exe
* [gsecdump](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0008)
* [Mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002)
* secretsdump.py

Alternatively, the SAM can be extracted from the Registry with Reg:

* <code>reg save HKLM\sam sam</code>
* <code>reg save HKLM\system system</code>

Creddump7 can then be used to process the SAM database locally to retrieve hashes.(Citation: GitHub Creddump7)

Notes: 
* RID 500 account is the local, built-in administrator.
* RID 501 is the guest account.
* User accounts start with a RID of 1,000+.

These credentials may be reused across whole product lines or device models and are often not published or known to the owner and operators of the asset. 

Adversaries may utilize these hardcoded credentials to move throughout the control system environment or provide reliable access for their tools to interact with industrial assets.

access to serial COM to prevent instructions or configurations from reaching target devices.

Devices also use serial COM to send command and reporting messages. Blocking device serial COM may also block command messages and block reporting messages.   A serial to Ethernet converter is often connected to a serial COM to facilitate communication between serial and Ethernet devices. One approach to blocking a serial COM would be to create and hold open a TCP session with the Ethernet side of the converter. A serial to Ethernet converter may have a few ports open to facilitate multiple communications. For example, if there are three serial COM available -- 1, 2 and 3 --, the converter might be listening on the corresponding ports 20001, 20002, and 20003. If a TCP/IP connection is opened with one of these ports and held open, then the port will be unavailable for use by another party. One way the adversary could achieve this would be to initiate a TCP session with the serial to Ethernet converter at 10.0.0.1 via Telnet on serial port 1 with the following command: telnet 10.0.0.1 20001.</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Adversaries may block access to serial COM to prevent instructions or configurations from reaching target devices.

Many controllers have CLI interfaces for management purposes.</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[0]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-ics-attack</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-attack</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_version</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>1.0</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>1.1</td></tr></tbody></table></details><hr><h4>[T0885] Commonly Used Port</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.1</p><p><b>Version changed from</b>: 1.0 → 1.1</p><p><b>New Detections</b>:</p><ul>  <li>DS0029: Network Traffic (Network Traffic Content)</li></ul><details><summary>Details</summary><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>values_changed</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>modified</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2022-05-24 14:31:04.264000+00:00</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2022-09-27 18:49:25.201000+00:00</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[0]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-ics-attack</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-attack</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_version</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>1.0</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>1.1</td></tr></tbody></table></details><hr><h4>[T0884] Connection Proxy</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.1</p><p><b>Version changed from</b>: 1.0 → 1.1</p><p><b>Dropped Detections</b>:</p><ul>  <li>DS0029: Network Traffic (Network Connection Creation)</li></ul><details><summary>Details</summary><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>dictionary_item_added</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_deprecated</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>False</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_detection</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_is_subtechnique</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>False</td></tr></tbody></table><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>values_changed</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>modified</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2022-05-06 17:47:23.900000+00:00</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2022-10-20 21:01:00.402000+00:00</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>description</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Adversaries may use a connection proxy to direct network traffic between systems or act as an intermediary for network communications.

Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security constructs such as permission levels will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques, so adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions. (Citation: The MITRE Corporation)  When initially gaining access to a system, an adversary may be operating within a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources on the system. Vulnerabilities may exist, usually in operating system components and software commonly running at higher permissions, that can be exploited to gain higher levels of access on the system. This could enable someone to move from unprivileged or user level permissions to SYSTEM or root permissions depending on the component that is vulnerable. This may be a necessary step for an adversary compromising an endpoint system that has been properly configured and limits other privilege escalation methods.

A GUI allows users to move a cursor and click on interface objects, with a mouse and keyboard as the main input devices, as opposed to just using the keyboard.  If physical access is not an option, then access might be possible via protocols such as VNC on Linux-based and Unix-based operating systems, and RDP on Windows operating systems. An adversary can use this access to execute programs and applications on the target machine.

This can be as simple as renaming a file to effectively disguise it in the ICS environment.</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[0]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-ics-attack</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-attack</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_version</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>1.0</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>1.1</td></tr></tbody></table></details><hr><h4>[T0838] Modify Alarm Settings</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.1</p><p><b>Version changed from</b>: 1.0 → 1.1</p>

These devices operate via programs that dictate how and when to perform actions based on such parameters. Such parameters can determine the extent to which an action is performed and may specify additional options. For example, a program on a control system device dictating motor processes may take a parameter defining the total number of seconds to run that motor.      

An adversary can potentially modify these parameters to produce an outcome outside of what was intended by the operators. By modifying system and process critical parameters, the adversary may cause [Impact](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0105) to equipment and/or control processes. Modified parameters may be turned into dangerous, out-of-bounds, or unexpected values from typical operations. For example, specifying that a process run for more or less time than it should, or dictating an unusually high, low, or invalid value as a parameter.   

In the Maroochy Attack, Vitek Boden gained remote computer access to the control system and altered data so that whatever function should have occurred at affected pumping stations did not occur or occurred in a different way. The software program installed in the laptop was one developed by Hunter Watertech for its use in changing configurations in the PDS computers. This ultimately led to 800,000 liters of raw sewage being spilled out into the community. (Citation: Marshall Abrams July 2008)  

In the Oldsmar water treatment attack, adversaries raised the sodium hydroxide setpoint value from 100 part-per-million (ppm) to 11,100 ppm, far beyond normal operating levels.

For example, specifying that a process run for more or less time than it should, or dictating an unusually high, low, or invalid value as a parameter.

In the Maroochy Shire attack, the adversary gained remote computer access to the control system and altered data so that whatever function should have occurred at affected pumping stations did not occur or occurred in a different way. The software program installed in the laptop was one developed for changing configurations in the PDS computers. This ultimately led to 800,000 liters of raw sewage being spilled out into the community.(Citation: Marshall Abrams July 2008)</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[0]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-ics-attack</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-attack</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[1]['url']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>https://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/pdf/08_1145.pdf</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>https://web.archive.org/web/20200802103218/https://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/pdf/08_1145.pdf</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_version</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>1.0</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>1.1</td></tr></tbody></table><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>iterable_item_removed</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>{'source_name': 'Pinellas County Sheriffs Office February 2021', 'description': 'Pinellas County Sheriffs Office 2021, February 8 Treatment Plant Intrusion Press Conference Retrieved. 2021/10/08 ', 'url': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkXDSOgLQ6M'}</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td></tr></tbody></table></details><hr><h4>[T0889] Modify Program</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.1</p><p><b>Version changed from</b>: 1.0 → 1.1</p><p><b>New Detections</b>:</p><ul>  <li>DS0015: Application Log (Application Log Content)</li>  <li>DS0029: Network Traffic (Network Traffic Content)</li>  <li>DS0039: Asset (Software)</li>  <li>DS0040: Operational Databases (Device Alarm)</li></ul><p><b>Dropped Detections</b>:</p><ul>  <li>DS0022: File (File Modification)</li></ul><details><summary>Details</summary><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>dictionary_item_added</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_deprecated</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>False</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_detection</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_is_subtechnique</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>False</td></tr></tbody></table><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>values_changed</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>modified</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2022-05-06 17:47:23.953000+00:00</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2022-09-27 16:08:15.574000+00:00</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>description</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Adversaries may modify or add a program on a controller to affect how it interacts with the physical process, peripheral devices and other hosts on the network.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action.

An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.

Supply chain compromise is the manipulation of products, such as devices or software, or their delivery mechanisms before receipt by the end consumer. Adversary compromise of these products and mechanisms is done for the goal of data or system compromise, once infected products are introduced to the target environment.   Supply chain compromise can occur at all stages of the supply chain, from manipulation of development tools and environments to manipulation of developed products and tools distribution mechanisms. This may involve the compromise and replacement of legitimate software and patches, such as on third party or vendor websites. Targeting of supply chain compromise can be done in attempts to infiltrate the environments of a specific audience. In control systems environments with assets in both the IT and OT networks, it is possible a supply chain compromise affecting the IT environment could enable further access to the OT environment.   Counterfeit devices may be introduced to the global supply chain posing safety and cyber risks to asset owners and operators. These devices may not meet the safety, engineering and manufacturing requirements of regulatory bodies but may feature tagging indicating conformance with industry standards.

Wireless compromise can be done as an initial access vector from a remote distance.     A joint case study on the Maroochy Shire Water Services event examined the attack from a cyber security perspective. (Citation: Marshall Abrams July 2008) The adversary disrupted Maroochy Shire's radio-controlled sewage system by driving around with stolen radio equipment and issuing commands with them. Boden used a two-way radio to communicate with and set the frequencies of Maroochy Shire's repeater stations.   A Polish student used a modified TV remote controller to gain access to and control over the Lodz city tram system in Poland. (Citation: John Bill May 2017) (Citation: Shelley Smith February 2008) The remote controller device allowed the student to interface with the trams network to modify track settings and override operator control. The adversary may have accomplished this by aligning the controller to the frequency and amplitude of IR control protocol signals. (Citation: Bruce Schneier January 2008) The controller then enabled initial access to the network, allowing the capture and replay of tram signals.

(Citation: Alexander Bolshev, Gleb Cherbov July 2014) (Citation: Alexander Bolshev March 2014) Adversaries may also utilize radios and other wireless communication devices on the same frequency as the wireless network. Wireless compromise can be done as an initial access vector from a remote distance. 

In the Maroochy Shire attack, the adversary used a two-way radio to communicate with and set the frequencies of Maroochy Shire's repeater stations.(Citation: Marshall Abrams July 2008)

A Polish student used a modified TV remote controller to gain access to and control over the Lodz city tram system in Poland. (Citation: John Bill May 2017) (Citation: Shelley Smith February 2008) The remote controller device allowed the student to interface with the trams network to modify track settings and override operator control. The adversary may have accomplished this by aligning the controller to the frequency and amplitude of IR control protocol signals. (Citation: Bruce Schneier January 2008) The controller then enabled initial access to the network, allowing the capture and replay of tram signals.

In the 2017 Dallas Siren incident, it is suspected that adversaries likely captured wireless command message broadcasts on a 700 MHz frequency during a regular test of the system. These messages were later replayed to trigger the alarm systems. (Citation: Gallagher, S.

This technique may result in device and operational equipment breakdown, or represent tangential damage from other techniques used in an attack. Depending on the severity of physical damage and disruption caused to control processes and systems, this technique may result in [Loss of Safety](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0880). Operations that result in [Loss of Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0827) may also cause damage to property, which may be directly or indirectly motivated by an adversary seeking to cause impact in the form of [Loss of Productivity and Revenue](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0828).   The German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) reported a targeted attack on a steel mill under an incidents affecting business section of its 2014 IT Security Report. (Citation: BSI State of IT Security 2014)  These targeted attacks affected industrial operations and resulted in breakdowns of control system components and even entire installations. As a result of these breakdowns, massive impact and damage resulted from the uncontrolled shutdown of a blast furnace.  In the Maroochy Attack, Vitek Boden gained remote computer access to the control system and altered data so that whatever function should have occurred at affected pumping stations did not occur or occurred in a different way. This ultimately led to 800,000 liters of raw sewage being spilled out into the community. The raw sewage affected local parks, rivers, and even a local hotel. This resulted in harm to marine life and produced a sickening stench from the community's now blackened rivers. (Citation: Marshall Abrams July 2008)  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. (Citation: John Bill May 2017) (Citation: Shelley Smith February 2008) (Citation: Bruce Schneier January 2008) Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. This resulted in damage to impacted trams, people, and the surrounding property. Reportedly, four trams were derailed and were forced to make emergency stops. (Citation: Shelley Smith February 2008) Commands issued by the student may have also resulted in tram collisions, causing harm to those on board and the environment outside.

Operations that result in [Loss of Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0827) may also cause damage to property, which may be directly or indirectly motivated by an adversary seeking to cause impact in the form of [Loss of Productivity and Revenue](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0828). 

In the Maroochy Shire attack, the adversary gained remote computer access to the control system and altered data so that whatever function should have occurred at affected pumping stations did not occur or occurred in a different way. This ultimately led to 800,000 liters of raw sewage being spilled out into the community. The raw sewage affected local parks, rivers, and even a local hotel. This resulted in harm to marine life and produced a sickening stench from the community's now blackened rivers.(Citation: Marshall Abrams July 2008)

The German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) reported a targeted attack on a steel mill under an incidents affecting business section of its 2014 IT Security Report. (Citation: BSI State of IT Security 2014)  These targeted attacks affected industrial operations and resulted in breakdowns of control system components and even entire installations. As a result of these breakdowns, massive impact and damage resulted from the uncontrolled shutdown of a blast furnace. 

A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. (Citation: John Bill May 2017) (Citation: Shelley Smith February 2008) (Citation: Bruce Schneier January 2008) Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. This resulted in damage to impacted trams, people, and the surrounding property. Reportedly, four trams were derailed and were forced to make emergency stops. (Citation: Shelley Smith February 2008) Commands issued by the student may have also resulted in tram collisions, causing harm to those on board and the environment outside.

Business analysis systems can also be provided with inaccurate data leading to bad management decisions.</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[0]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-ics-attack</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-attack</td></tr></tbody></table></details><hr><h4>[T0801] Monitor Process State</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>New Detections</b>:</p><ul>  <li>DS0015: Application Log (Application Log Content)</li></ul><details><summary>Details</summary><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>dictionary_item_added</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>x_mitre_is_subtechnique</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'></td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>False</td></tr></tbody></table><table style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'><caption>values_changed</caption><thead><tr><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>STIX Field</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Old value</th><th style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>New Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>modified</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2022-05-06 17:47:23.955000+00:00</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>2022-10-24 15:09:07.609000+00:00</td></tr><tr><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>external_references[0]['source_name']</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-ics-attack</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>mitre-attack</td></tr></tbody></table></details><hr><h4>[T0834] Native API</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p>

These interpreters read and compile part of the source code just before it is executed, as opposed to compilers, which compile each and every line of code to an executable file. Scripting allows software developers to run their code on any system where the interpreter exists. This way, they can distribute one package, instead of precompiling executables for many different systems. Scripting languages, such as Python, have their interpreters shipped as a default with many Linux distributions.    In addition to being a useful tool for developers and administrators, scripting language interpreters may be abused by the adversary to execute code in the target environment. Due to the nature of scripting languages, this allows for weaponized code to be deployed to a target easily, and leaves open the possibility of on-the-fly scripting to perform a task.</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;'>Adversaries may use scripting languages to execute arbitrary code in the form of a pre-written script or in the form of user-supplied code to an interpreter.

Based on the observed techniques, tools, and network activities, security researchers assessed the campaign involved a threat group based in China.(Citation: McAfee Night Dragon)</p><hr><h4>[C0012] Operation CuckooBees</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: [Operation CuckooBees](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0012) was a cyber espionage campaign targeting technology and manufacturing companies in East Asia, Western Europe, and North America since at least 2019. Security researchers noted the goal of [Operation CuckooBees](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0012), which was still ongoing as of May 2022, was likely the theft of proprietary information, research and development documents, source code, and blueprints for various technologies. Researchers assessed [Operation CuckooBees](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0012) was conducted by actors affiliated with [Winnti Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0044), [APT41](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0096), and BARIUM.(Citation: Cybereason OperationCuckooBees May 2022)</p><hr><h4>[C0016] Operation Dust Storm</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: [Operation Dust Storm](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0016) was a long-standing persistent cyber espionage campaign that targeted multiple industries in Japan, South Korea, the United States, Europe, and several Southeast Asian countries. By 2015, the [Operation Dust Storm](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0016) threat actors shifted from government and defense-related intelligence targets to Japanese companies or Japanese subdivisions of larger foreign organizations supporting Japan's critical infrastructure, including electricity generation, oil and natural gas, finance, transportation, and construction.(Citation: Cylance Dust Storm)

[Operation Dust Storm](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0016) threat actors also began to use Android backdoors in their operations by 2015, with all identified victims at the time residing in Japan or South Korea.(Citation: Cylance Dust Storm)</p><hr><h4>[C0006] Operation Honeybee</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: [Operation Honeybee](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0006) was a campaign that targeted humanitarian aid and inter-Korean affairs organizations from at least late 2017 through early 2018. [Operation Honeybee](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0006) initially targeted South Korea, but expanded to include Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, Indonesia, Argentina, and Canada. Security researchers assessed the threat actors were likely Korean speakers based on metadata used in both lure documents and executables, and named the campaign "Honeybee" after the author name discovered in malicious Word documents.(Citation: McAfee Honeybee) </p><hr><h4>[C0013] Operation Sharpshooter</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: [Operation Sharpshooter](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0013) was a global cyber espionage campaign that targeted nuclear, defense, government, energy, and financial companies, with many located in Germany, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Security researchers noted the campaign shared many similarities with previous [Lazarus Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032) operations, including fake job recruitment lures and shared malware code.(Citation: McAfee Sharpshooter December 2018)(Citation: Bleeping Computer Op Sharpshooter March 2019)(Citation: Threatpost New Op Sharpshooter Data March 2019)    </p><hr><h4>[C0005] Operation Spalax</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: [Operation Spalax](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0005) was a campaign that primarily targeted Colombian government organizations and private companies, particularly those associated with the energy and metallurgical industries. The [Operation Spalax](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0005) threat actors distributed commodity malware and tools using generic phishing topics related to COVID-19, banking, and law enforcement action. Security researchers noted indicators of compromise and some infrastructure overlaps with other campaigns dating back to April 2018, including at least one separately attributed to [APT-C-36](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0099), however identified enough differences to report this as separate, unattributed activity.(Citation: ESET Operation Spalax Jan 2021)  </p><hr><h4>[C0014] Operation Wocao</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: [Operation Wocao](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0014) was a cyber espionage campaign that targeted organizations around the world, including in Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The suspected China-based actors compromised government organizations and managed service providers, as well as aviation, construction, energy, finance, health care, insurance, offshore engineering, software development, and transportation companies.(Citation: FoxIT Wocao December 2019)

Security researchers assessed the [Operation Wocao](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0014) actors used similar TTPs and tools as APT20, suggesting a possible overlap. [Operation Wocao](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0014) was named after an observed command line entry by one of the threat actors, possibly out of frustration from losing webshell access.(Citation: FoxIT Wocao December 2019)</p></details><h3>mobile-attack</h3><details><summary>New Campaigns</summary><hr><h4>[C0016] Operation Dust Storm</h4><p><b>Current version</b>: 1.0</p><p><b>Description</b>: [Operation Dust Storm](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0016) was a long-standing persistent cyber espionage campaign that targeted multiple industries in Japan, South Korea, the United States, Europe, and several Southeast Asian countries.
