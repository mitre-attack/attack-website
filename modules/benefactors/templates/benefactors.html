        <h1>Benefactors Program</h1>
        <p>
          MITRE ATT&CK<sup>&reg;</sup> is a globally-accessible, community-driven knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. 
          The ATT&CK framework is used as a blueprint for the development of specific threat models and methodologies across the private sector, government, and the cybersecurity product and service community. 
          Benefactors sustain and advance ATT&CK through their financial contributions, ensuring that it adapts along with evolving cyber threats and changing environments.
        </p>
        <h1>Benefactors</h1>
        <p>
          Become an ATT&CK Benefactor! Benefactors help propel the evolution of ATT&CK through financial contributions. Donations directly support framework progression, pioneering research into underrepresented domains and emerging threats, and community engagement. 
          To show our thanks, ATT&CK benefactors are also the recipient of many benefits, including public recognition as a benefactor of MITRE ATT&CK as well as briefings with the ATT&CK leadership team.
