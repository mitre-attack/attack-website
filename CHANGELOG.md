        The control to toggle between them appears only when sub-techniques are present in the matrix.
    * Sub-techniques can be hidden and shown under their parent by clicking the gray sidebar.
    * Show-all / hide-all buttons were added to show/hide all sub-techniques. See issue [#43](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-website/issues/43).

# v1.3.1 (2020-06-17)

This update includes a major refactor of the ATT&CK catalog versioning system, previously referred to as "previous versions."

  * Current version is preserved alongside other versions in `/versions/`.
  * Object pages on the live website now have a "version permalink" leading to a frozen version of that page.
  * Permalink and previous versions now have a "live version" link leading to the most recent version of that page.
* Revised the version list. Find the new version list on the [Versions of ATT&CK page](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/versions), which replaced the "previous versions" page.
  * Now formatted as an easy to read table.
  * Added links to the data on [MITRE/CTI](https://github.com/mitre/cti) for each version.
