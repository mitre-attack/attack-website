A wide variety of virtualization technologies exist that allow for the emulation of a computer or computing environment. By running malicious code inside of a virtual instance, adversaries can hide artifacts associated with their behavior from security tools that are unable to monitor activity inside the virtual instance.(Citation: CyberCX Akira Ransomware) Additionally, depending on the virtual networking implementation (ex: bridged adapter), network traffic generated by the virtual instance can be difficult to trace back to the compromised host as the IP address and hostname might not match known values.(Citation: SingHealth Breach Jan 2019)\n\nAdversaries may utilize native support for virtualization (ex: Hyper-V), deploy lightweight emulators (ex: QEMU), or drop the necessary files to run a virtual instance (ex: VirtualBox binaries).(Citation: Securonix CronTrap 2024) After running a virtual instance, adversaries may create a shared folder between the guest and host with permissions that enable the virtual instance to interact with the host file system.(Citation: Sophos Ragnar May 2020)\n\nThreat actors may also leverage temporary virtualized environments such as the Windows Sandbox, which supports the use of `.wsb` configuration files for defining execution parameters. For example, the `<MappedFolder>` property supports the creation of a shared folder, while the `<LogonCommand>` property allows the specification of a payload.(Citation: ESET MirrorFace 2025)(Citation: ITOCHU Hack the Sandbox)(Citation: ITOCHU Sandbox PPT)\n\nIn VMWare environments, adversaries may leverage the vCenter console to create new virtual machines. However, they may also create virtual machines directly on ESXi servers by running a valid `.vmx` file with the `/bin/vmx` utility. Adding this command to `/etc/rc.local.d/local.sh` (i.e., [RC Scripts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/004)) will cause the VM to persistently restart.(Citation: vNinja Rogue VMs 2024) Creating a VM this way prevents it from appearing in the vCenter console or in the output to the `vim-cmd vmsvc/getallvms` command on the ESXi server, thereby hiding it from typical administrative activities.(Citation: MITRE VMware Abuse 2024)",

                    "description": "Adversaries may abuse dynamic-link library files (DLLs) in order to achieve persistence, escalate privileges, and evade defenses. DLLs are libraries that contain code and data that can be simultaneously utilized by multiple programs. While DLLs are not malicious by nature, they can be abused through mechanisms such as side-loading, hijacking search order, and phantom DLL hijacking.(Citation: unit 42)\n\nSpecific ways DLLs are abused by adversaries include:\n\n### DLL Sideloading\nAdversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by side-loading DLLs. Side-loading involves hijacking which DLL a program loads by planting and then invoking a legitimate application that executes their payload(s).\n\nSide-loading positions both the victim application and malicious payload(s) alongside each other. Adversaries likely use side-loading as a means of masking actions they perform under a legitimate, trusted, and potentially elevated system or software process. Benign executables used to side-load payloads may not be flagged during delivery and/or execution. Adversary payloads may also be encrypted/packed or otherwise obfuscated until loaded into the memory of the trusted process.\n\nAdversaries may also side-load other packages, such as BPLs (Borland Package Library).(Citation: kroll bpl)\n\nAdversaries may chain DLL sideloading multiple times to fragment functionality hindering analysis. Adversaries using multiple DLL files can split the loader functions across different DLLs, with a main DLL loading the separated export functions. (Citation: Virus Bulletin) Spreading loader functions across multiple DLLs makes analysis harder, since all files must be collected to fully understand the malware\u2019s behavior.  Another method implements a \u201cloader-for-a-loader\u201d, where a malicious DLL\u2019s sole role is to load a second DLL (or a chain of DLLs) that contain the real payload. (Citation: Sophos)\n\n### DLL Search Order Hijacking\nAdversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order that Windows uses to load DLLs. This search order is a sequence of special and standard search locations that a program checks when loading a DLL. An adversary can plant a trojan DLL in a directory that will be prioritized by the DLL search order over the location of a legitimate library. This will cause Windows to load the malicious DLL when it is called for by the victim program.(Citation: unit 42)\n\n### DLL Redirection\nAdversaries may directly modify the search order via DLL redirection, which after being enabled (in the Registry or via the creation of a redirection file) may cause a program to load a DLL from a different location.(Citation: Microsoft redirection)(Citation: Microsoft - manifests/assembly)\n\n### Phantom DLL Hijacking\nAdversaries may leverage phantom DLL hijacking by targeting references to non-existent DLL files. They may be able to load their own malicious DLL by planting it with the correct name in the location of the missing module.(Citation: Hexacorn DLL Hijacking)(Citation: Hijack DLLs CrowdStrike)\n\n### DLL Substitution\nAdversaries may target existing, valid DLL files and substitute them with their own malicious DLLs, planting them with the same name and in the same location as the valid DLL file.(Citation: Wietze Beukema DLL Hijacking)\n\nPrograms that fall victim to DLL hijacking may appear to behave normally because malicious DLLs may be configured to also load the legitimate DLLs they were meant to replace, evading defenses.\n\nRemote DLL hijacking can occur when a program sets its current directory to a remote location, such as a Web share, before loading a DLL.(Citation: dll pre load owasp)(Citation: microsoft remote preloading)\n\nIf a valid DLL is configured to run at a higher privilege level, then the adversary-controlled DLL that is loaded will also be executed at the higher level. In this case, the technique could be used for privilege escalation.",

Access through trusted third party relationship abuses an existing connection that may not be protected or receives less scrutiny than standard mechanisms of gaining access to a network.\n\nOrganizations often grant elevated access to second or third-party external providers in order to allow them to manage internal systems as well as cloud-based environments. Some examples of these relationships include IT services contractors, managed security providers, infrastructure contractors (e.g. HVAC, elevators, physical security). The third-party provider's access may be intended to be limited to the infrastructure being maintained, but may exist on the same network as the rest of the enterprise. As such, [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) used by the other party for access to internal network systems may be compromised and used.(Citation: CISA IT Service Providers)\n\nIn Office 365 environments, organizations may grant Microsoft partners or resellers delegated administrator permissions. By compromising a partner or reseller account, an adversary may be able to leverage existing delegated administrator relationships or send new delegated administrator offers to clients in order to gain administrative control over the victim tenant.(Citation: Office 365 Delegated Administration)",

[Kimsuky](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094) has focused collection on foreign policy and national security issues tied to the Korean Peninsula, nuclear policy, and sanctions.

Monitoring this activity is critical to detecting potential unauthorized or malicious actions, such as data destruction by adversaries or accidental deletions that may lead to data loss. Examples: \n\n- AWS S3 Bucket Deletion: An AWS user deletes an S3 bucket using the `DeleteBucket` API call.\n- Azure Blob Storage Container Deletion: A user deletes a container in Azure Blob Storage using the `Delete Container` operation.\n- Google Cloud Storage Bucket Deletion: A Google Cloud user deletes a bucket using the `storage.buckets.delete` API.\n- OpenStack Swift Container Deletion: A user deletes a container in OpenStack Swift using the `DELETE` method.\n\nThis data component can be collected through the following measures:\n\nEnable Logging for Cloud Storage Services\n\n- AWS S3: Enable AWS CloudTrail to log DeleteBucket API actions.\n- Azure Blob Storage: Enable Azure Monitor and Diagnostic Logs to capture Delete Container operations. Use Azure Event Grid to capture and trigger alerts for container deletion.\n- Google Cloud Storage: Enable Data Access logs in Cloud Audit Logs to monitor storage.buckets.delete API calls.\n- OpenStack Swift: Configure Swift logging to capture DELETE requests for containers.\n\nCentralized Logging and Analysis\n\n- Use platforms like Splunk or native SIEMs to forward and analyze logs for anomalies in cloud storage deletions.",

Examples: \n\n- File Read Operations: A user opens a sensitive document (e.g., financial_report.xlsx) on a shared drive.\n- File Execution: A script or executable file is accessed and executed (e.g., malware.exe is run from a temporary directory).\n- Unauthorized File Access: An unauthorized user attempts to access a protected configuration file (e.g., `/etc/passwd` on Linux or `System32` files on Windows).\n- File Access Patterns: Bulk access to multiple files in a short time (e.g., mass access to documents on a file server).\n- File Access via Network: Files on a network share are accessed remotely (e.g., logs of SMB file access).",

File metadata provides insights into a file's characteristics and can be used to detect malicious activity, unauthorized modifications, or other anomalies. Examples: \n\n- File Ownership and Permissions: Checking the owner and permissions of a critical configuration file like /etc/passwd on Linux or C:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\SAM on Windows.\n- Timestamps: Analyzing the creation, modification, and access timestamps of a file.\n- File Content and Signatures: Extracting the headers of an executable file to verify its signature or detect packing/obfuscation.\n- File Attributes: Analyzing attributes like hidden, system, or read-only flags in Windows.\n- File Hashes: Generating MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256 hashes of files to compare against threat intelligence feeds.\n- File Location: Monitoring files located in unusual directories or paths, such as temporary or user folders.",

ProcMon can provide granular details on API usage and identify malicious behavior during analysis.\\n-- Windows Event Logs:\\n-    - Use Event IDs from Windows logs for specific API-related activities:\\n-        - Event ID 4688: A new process has been created (can indirectly infer API use).\\n-        - Event ID 4657: A registry value has been modified (to monitor registry-altering APIs).\\n-- Dynamic Analysis Tools:\\n-    - Tools like Cuckoo Sandbox, Flare VM, or Hybrid Analysis monitor API execution during malware detonation.\\n-- Host-Based Logs:\\n-    - On Linux/macOS systems, leverage audit frameworks (e.g., `auditd`, `strace`) to capture and analyze system call usage that APIs map to.\\n-- Runtime Monitors:\\n-    - Runtime security tools like Falco can monitor system-level calls for API execution.\\n-- Debugging and Tracing:\\n-    - Use debugging tools like gdb (Linux) or WinDbg (Windows) for deep tracing of API executions in real time.\"}, \"root['x_mitre_log_sources'][19]['channel']\": {\"new_value\": \"EventCode=4663, 4670, 4656\", \"old_value\": \"EventCode=4656\"}}}",

Examples: \n\n- File Read Operations: A user opens a sensitive document (e.g., financial_report.xlsx) on a shared drive.\n- File Execution: A script or executable file is accessed and executed (e.g., malware.exe is run from a temporary directory).\n- Unauthorized File Access: An unauthorized user attempts to access a protected configuration file (e.g., `/etc/passwd` on Linux or `System32` files on Windows).\n- File Access Patterns: Bulk access to multiple files in a short time (e.g., mass access to documents on a file server).\n- File Access via Network: Files on a network share are accessed remotely (e.g., logs of SMB file access).",

File metadata provides insights into a file's characteristics and can be used to detect malicious activity, unauthorized modifications, or other anomalies. Examples: \n\n- File Ownership and Permissions: Checking the owner and permissions of a critical configuration file like /etc/passwd on Linux or C:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\SAM on Windows.\n- Timestamps: Analyzing the creation, modification, and access timestamps of a file.\n- File Content and Signatures: Extracting the headers of an executable file to verify its signature or detect packing/obfuscation.\n- File Attributes: Analyzing attributes like hidden, system, or read-only flags in Windows.\n- File Hashes: Generating MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256 hashes of files to compare against threat intelligence feeds.\n- File Location: Monitoring files located in unusual directories or paths, such as temporary or user folders.",
