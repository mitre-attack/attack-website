                            The security community tracks intrusion activity using various analytic methodologies and terms, such as operations, intrusion sets, and campaigns.
                            Some intrusion activity may be referenced by a variety of names due to different organizations tracking similar activity, often from different vantage points;
                            conversely other times reported activity is not given a designated name.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Malicious cyber activity may be attributed to a threat group, or referenced as unattributed activity.
                            Alternatively, complex cyber operations may involve multiple affiliated or unaffiliated groups, with each playing a unique role
                            (ie. initial access, data exfiltration, etc).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the purposes of the Campaigns page, the MITRE ATT&CK team uses the term Campaign to describe any grouping of intrusion activity
                            conducted over a specific period of time with common targets and objectives.
                            Unnamed intrusion activity is cited using a unique ATT&CK identifier, otherwise the team will use the activity name as noted in public reporting.
                            For named Campaigns, the team makes a best effort to track overlapping names, which are designated as “Associated Campaigns” on each page,
                            as we believe these overlaps are useful for analysts.
                            Campaign entries will also be attributed to ATT&CK Group and Software pages, when possible, based on public reporting;
                            unattributed activity will simply reference “threat actors” in the procedure example.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Campaigns are mapped to publicly reporting techniques and original references are included.
                            The information provided does not represent all possible techniques used in a Campaign but rather a subset that is available through open source reporting.
                        </p>

The malware and techniques used within this campaign targeted specific Triconex <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/assets/A0010">Safety Controller</a>s within the environment. The incident was eventually discovered due to a safety trip that occurred as a result of an issue in the malware.</p>
