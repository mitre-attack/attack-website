"content": " File Creation A new file is created on a system or network storage. This action often signifies an operation such as saving a document, writing data, or deploying a file. Logging these events helps identify legitimate or potentially malicious file creation activities. Examples include logging file creation events (e.g., Sysmon Event ID 11 or Linux auditd logs). This data component can be collected through the following measures: Windows Sysmon: Event ID 11: Logs file creation events, capturing details like the file path, hash, and creation time. Windows Event Log: Enable \"Object Access\" auditing in Group Policy to track file creation under Event ID 4663. PowerShell: Real-time monitoring of file creation:Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; ID=4663} Linux Auditd: Use audit rules to monitor file creation: auditctl -w /path/to/directory -p w -k file_creation View logs: ausearch -k file_creation Inotify: Monitor file creation with inotifywait: inotifywait -m /path/to/watch -e create macOS Unified Logs: Use the macOS Unified Logging System to capture file creation events. FSEvents: Use File System Events to monitor file creation: fs_usage | grep create Network Devices NAS Logs: Monitor file creation events on network-attached storage devices. SMB Logs: Collect logs of file creation activities over SMB/CIFS protocols. SIEM Integration Forward logs from all platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) to a SIEM for central analysis and alerting.

"path": "/datacomponents/DC0093/index.html",
"content": " Certificate Registration Certificate Registration refers to the collection and analysis of information about digital certificates, including current, revoked, and expired certificates. Sources such as Certificate Transparency logs and other public resources provide visibility into certificates issued for specific domains or organizations. Monitoring certificate registrations can help identify potential misuse, such as unauthorized certificates or signs of adversary reconnaissance. Examples: Certificate Transparency Logs: These logs record the issuance of SSL/TLS certificates by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs). Revoked Certificates: Information about certificates that have been invalidated before their expiration date. Expired Certificates: Reports of expired certificates for a domain, which may indicate lax security practices or opportunities for adversaries to exploit expired credentials. Domain Monitoring for Certificates: Maps SSL/TLS certificates to domains and subdomains, helping to identify any rogue certificates. Public Certificate Directories: Services providing APIs to query issued certificates for analysis. This data component can be collected through the following measures: Use Certificate Transparency Monitors Tools like crt.sh, CertStream, or APIs provided by certificate authorities (CAs) allow you to monitor issued certificates in real-time. Example: Use CertStream to stream certificate issuance logs and filter for domains of interest. Analyze Certificate Revocation Sources Monitor CRLs or query OCSP responders to detect revoked certificates. Configure tools like OpenSSL or browsers to validate certificate revocation status automatically. Leverage Public Scanning Tools Use tools such as SSL Labs, Censys, or Shodan to scan for certificate details related to your domain or network. Automate Certificate Monitoring Set up automated scripts or services to parse Certificate Transparency logs for anomalies. Example: Automate searches on crt.sh to identify certificates issued for typo-squatted domains. Integrate with Threat Intelligence Enrich certificate data with threat intelligence feeds to detect connections to known adversary-controlled infrastructure. Tools like VirusTotal can identify malicious certificates based on associated indicators.

This action is typically performed to extend the functionality of an application, access shared system resources, or interact with kernel-mode components. Data Collection Measures: Event Logging (Windows): Sysmon Event ID 7: Logs when a DLL is loaded into a process. Windows Security Event ID 4688: Captures process creation events, often useful for correlating module loads. Windows Defender ATP: Can provide visibility into suspicious module loads. Event Logging (Linux/macOS): AuditD (execve and open syscalls): Captures when shared libraries (.so files) are loaded. Ltrace/Strace: Monitors process behavior, including library calls (dlopen, execve). MacOS Endpoint Security Framework (ESF): Monitors library loads (ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES). Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR): Provide real-time telemetry on module loads and process injections. Sysinternals Process Monitor (procmon): Captures loaded modules and their execution context. Memory Forensics: Volatility Framework (malfind, ldrmodules): Detects injected DLLs and anomalous module loads. Rekall Framework: Useful for kernel-mode module detection.

This activity may be performed for legitimate administrative purposes or malicious reconnaissance by adversaries seeking to identify accessible storage resources.Examples: AWS S3 Bucket Enumeration: An AWS user lists all buckets using the ListBuckets API call. Azure Blob Storage Container Enumeration: A user retrieves a list of all containers within a storage account using the Azure Storage SDK or API. Google Cloud Storage Bucket Enumeration: A Google Cloud user lists all buckets within a project using the storage.buckets.list API. OpenStack Swift Container Enumeration: A user retrieves a list of containers in OpenStack Swift using the GET method on the storage endpoint. This data component can be collected through the following measures: Enable Logging for Cloud Storage Enumeration AWS S3: Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture ListBuckets and ListObjects API calls. Azure Blob Storage: Enable Azure Monitor and Diagnostic Logs to capture enumeration operations like List Containers. Use Azure Event Grid to trigger alerts for container enumeration. Google Cloud Storage: Enable Audit Logs in Google Cloud to track storage.buckets.list API activity. OpenStack Swift: Configure Swift logging to capture GET requests for container enumeration.

"content": " Response Content Captured network traffic that provides details about responses received during an internet scan. This data includes both protocol header values (e.g., HTTP status codes, IP headers, or DNS response codes) and response body content (e.g., HTML, JSON, or raw data). Examples: HTTP Scan: A web server responds to a probe with an HTTP 200 status code and an HTML body indicating the default page is accessible. DNS Scan: A DNS server replies to a query with a resolved IP address for a domain, along with details like Time-To-Live (TTL) and authoritative information. TCP Banner Grab: A service listening on a port (e.g., SSH or FTP) responds with a banner containing service name, version, or other metadata. Data Collection Measures: Network Traffic Monitoring: Deploy packet capture tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, or Suricata to log both headers and body content of response traffic. Use network appliances like firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), or intrusion prevention systems (IPS) with logging enabled to capture scan responses. Cloud Logging Services: AWS VPC Flow Logs: Capture metadata about network flows, including source and destination, protocol, and response codes. GCP Packet Mirroring: Use mirrored packets to analyze responses. Azure NSG Flow Logs: Record network traffic flow information for analysis. Specific Tools: Zmap or Masscan: Can perform internet-wide scans and collect response content for analysis. Nmap: Use custom scripts to capture and log detailed response data during scans.

"content": " Kernel Module Load The process of loading a kernel module into the operating system kernel. Kernel modules are object files that extend the kernel\u2019s functionality, such as adding support for device drivers, new filesystems, or additional system calls. This action can be legitimate (e.g., loading a driver) or malicious (e.g., adding a rootkit). Data Collection Measures: Linux: Auditd: Enable auditing of kernel module loading. Example rule: -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S init_module,delete_module. Syslog: Monitor /var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages for entries related to kernel module loads. Systemd Journal: Use journalctl to query logs for module loading events: journalctl -k | grep \"Loading kernel module\" macOS: Unified Logs: Use the log command to query kernel module events: log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains \"kextload\"' --info Endpoint Security Framework (ESF): Monitor for ES_EVENT_TYPE_AUTH_KEXTLOAD (kernel extension loading events). Kernel-Specific Tools: Lsmod: Use lsmod to list loaded kernel modules in real-time. Kprobe/eBPF: Use extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) or Kernel Probes (kprobes) to monitor kernel events, including module loading. Example using eBPF tools like BCC:sudo python /path/to/bcc/tools/kprobe -v do_init_module Enable EDR Monitoring: Configure alerts for: Suspicious kernel module loads from non-standard paths (e.g., /tmp). Unexpected or unsigned kernel modules. Review detailed telemetry data provided by the EDR for insight into who initiated the module load, the file path, and whether the module was signed.

Network Drive Mapping: A network share \\\\server\\share is mapped to the drive Z:\\. Virtual Drive Creation: A virtual disk is mounted on /mnt/virtualdrive using an ISO image or a virtual hard disk (VHD). Cloud Storage Mounting: Google Drive is mounted as G:\\ on a Windows machine using a cloud sync tool. External Storage Integration: An external HDD or SSD is connected and assigned /mnt/external on a Linux system. This data component can be collected through the following measures: Windows Event Logs Relevant Events: Event ID 98: Logs the creation of a volume (mount or new drive letter assignment). Event ID 1006: Logs removable storage device insertions. Configuration: Enable \"Removable Storage Events\" in the Group Policy settings:Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Removable Storage Access Linux System Logs Command-Line Monitoring: Use dmesg or journalctl to monitor mount events. Auditd Configuration: Add audit rules to track mount points. Logs can be reviewed in /var/log/audit/audit.log. macOS System Logs Unified Logs: Monitor system logs for mount activity: Command-Line Tools: Use diskutil list to verify newly created or mounted drives. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Tools EDR solutions can log removable drive usage and network-mounted drives. Configure EDR policies to alert on suspicious drive creation events.

"content": " Host Status Logging, messaging, and other artifacts that highlight the health and operational state of host-based security sensors, such as Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, antivirus software, logging services, and system monitoring tools. Monitoring sensor health is essential for detecting misconfigurations, sensor failures, tampering, or deliberate security control evasion by adversaries. Data Collection Measures: Windows Event Logs: Event ID 1074 (System Shutdown): Detects unexpected system reboots/shutdowns. Event ID 6006 (Event Log Stopped): Logs when Windows event logging is stopped. Event ID 16 (Sysmon): Detects configuration state changes that may indicate log tampering. Event ID 12 (Windows Defender Status Change) \u2013 Detects changes in Windows Defender state. Linux/macOS Monitoring: /var/log/syslog, /var/log/auth.log, /var/log/kern.log Journald (journalctl) for kernel and system alerts.

"content": " Command Execution Command Execution involves monitoring and capturing the execution of textual commands (including shell commands, cmdlets, and scripts) within an operating system or application. These commands may include arguments or parameters and are typically executed through interpreters such as cmd.exe, bash, zsh, PowerShell, or programmatic execution. Examples: Windows Command Prompt dir \u2013 Lists directory contents. net user \u2013 Queries or manipulates user accounts. tasklist \u2013 Lists running processes. PowerShell Get-Process \u2013 Retrieves processes running on a system. Set-ExecutionPolicy \u2013 Changes PowerShell script execution policies. Invoke-WebRequest \u2013 Downloads remote resources. Linux Shell ls \u2013 Lists files in a directory. cat /etc/passwd \u2013 Reads the user accounts file. curl http://malicious-site.com \u2013 Retrieves content from a malicious URL. Container Environments docker exec \u2013 Executes a command inside a running container. kubectl exec \u2013 Runs commands in Kubernetes pods. macOS Terminal open \u2013 Opens files or URLs. dscl . -list /Users \u2013 Lists all users on the system. osascript -e \u2013 Executes AppleScript commands. This data component can be collected through the following measures: Enable Command Logging Windows: Enable PowerShell logging: Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass, Set-ItemProperty -Path \"HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\ScriptBlockLogging\" -Name EnableScriptBlockLogging -Value 1 Enable Windows Event Logging: Event ID 4688: Tracks process creation, including command-line arguments. Event ID 4104: Logs PowerShell script block execution. Linux/macOS: Enable shell history logging in .bashrc or .zshrc: export HISTTIMEFORMAT=\"%d/%m/%y %T \", export PROMPT_COMMAND='history -a; history -w' Use audit frameworks (e.g., auditd) to log command executions. Example rule to log all execve syscalls: -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -k cmd_exec Containers: Use runtime-specific tools like Docker\u2019s --log-driver or Kubernetes Audit Logs to capture exec commands.

"content": " Cloud Service Disable This data component refers to monitoring actions that deactivate or stop a cloud service in a cloud control plane. Examples include disabling essential logging services like AWS CloudTrail (StopLogging API call), Microsoft Azure Monitor Logs, or Google Cloud's Operations Suite (formerly Stackdriver). Disabling such services can hinder visibility into adversary activities within the cloud environment. Examples: AWS CloudTrail StopLogging: This action stops logging of API activity for a particular trail, effectively reducing the monitoring and visibility of AWS resources and activities. Microsoft Azure Monitor Logs: Disabling these logs hinders the organization\u2019s ability to detect anomalous activities and trace malicious actions. Google Cloud Logging: Disabling cloud logging removes visibility into resource activity, preventing monitoring of service access or configuration changes. SaaS Applications: Stopping logging removes visibility into user activities, such as email access or file downloads, enabling undetected malicious behavior. This data component can be collected through the following measures: Enable and Monitor Cloud Service Logging Ensure logging is enabled for all cloud services, including administrative actions like StopLogging. Example: Use AWS Config to verify that CloudTrail is enabled and enforce logging as a compliance rule. API Monitoring Use API monitoring tools to detect calls like StopLogging or equivalent service-stopping actions in other platforms. Example: Monitor AWS CloudWatch for specific API events such as StopLogging and flag unauthorized users. SIEM Integration Collect logs and events from the cloud control plane into a centralized SIEM for real-time analysis and correlation. Example: Ingest AWS CloudTrail logs into Splunk or Azure Monitor logs into Sentinel. Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) Tools Leverage CSPM tools like Prisma Cloud, Dome9, or AWS Security Hub to detect misconfigurations or suspicious activity, such as disabled logging. Example: Set alerts for changes to logging configurations in CSPM dashboards. Configure Alerts in Cloud Platforms Create native alerts in cloud platforms to detect service stoppages. Example: Configure an AWS CloudWatch alarm to trigger when StopLogging is invoked.

"content": " Malware Content Code, strings, signatures, and other identifying characteristics of a malicious payload stored within a malware repository. It includes both static (file-based) and dynamic (behavioral or execution-based) components that can be analyzed for threat intelligence, detection, and prevention purposes. Examples: Static Analysis: Executable Code: Analyze binary data to identify unique patterns, obfuscated code, or embedded resources. Strings Extraction: Use tools like strings or YARA rules to identify hardcoded URLs, IPs, filenames, or suspicious function calls. Signatures: Extract cryptographic hashes (MD5, SHA256) of files to track known malware variants or detect previously unseen samples. Dynamic Analysis: Behavioral Observations: Monitor execution traces to capture API calls, registry modifications, or network traffic patterns indicative of malicious behavior. Memory Analysis: Examine memory dumps to uncover injected code or runtime-decrypted payloads. Artifacts: Record file system changes, process creation events, and command-line arguments. Threat Intelligence Integration: Campaign Attribution: Associate observed code snippets or signatures with known APT campaigns or ransomware families. Indicator Sharing: Share identified Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) with threat intelligence platforms (e.g., MISP, OpenCTI). Examples of Malware Content: Embedded C2 domains (e.g., malicious-domain.com hardcoded in the payload). Fileless malware indicators, such as PowerShell scripts invoking Invoke-Mimikatz. Malware-specific signatures, such as unique PE header values for a particular strain. Data Collection Measures: Collection from Public Malware Repositories: VirusTotal: Obtain samples for static analysis. Hybrid Analysis: Gather execution data from sandbox analysis. Any.Run: Access interactive malware execution traces. MalwareBazaar: Download malware samples for research and signature generation. Automate data extraction using repository APIs (e.g., VirusTotal API for hash lookups or sample retrieval). Internal Malware Labs: Sandbox Environments: Use dynamic malware analysis tools such as Cuckoo Sandbox or Joe Sandbox to execute and monitor malware in a controlled environment. Capture runtime behavior logs, memory dumps, and file system changes. Reverse Engineering: Disassemble binaries with tools like IDA Pro, Ghidra, or Radare2 to identify malicious functionality and extract code patterns. EDR/Endpoint Telemetry: Collect samples of malicious binaries or scripts from infected endpoints using tools like CrowdStrike, Carbon Black, or SentinelOne. Extract memory-resident payloads from live systems for analysis. Threat Intelligence Platforms: Gather contextual metadata for identified malware using tools like OpenCTI, Recorded Future, or ThreatConnect. Participate in intelligence-sharing groups such as ISACs (e.g., FS-ISAC, IT-ISAC). Custom Data Collection Pipelines: Use open-source tools like malwoverview or Maltrail to automate sample downloads, hash extraction, and IOC generation.

"path": "/datacomponents/DC0083/index.html",
"content": " Cloud Service Enumeration Cloud service enumeration involves listing or querying available cloud services in a cloud control plane. This activity is often performed to identify resources such as virtual machines, storage buckets, compute clusters, or other services within a cloud environment. Examples include API calls like AWS ECS ListServices, Azure ListAllResources, or Google Cloud ListInstances. Examples: AWS Cloud Service Enumeration: The adversary gathers details about existing ECS services to identify opportunities for privilege escalation or exfiltration.- Azure Resource Enumeration: The adversary collects information about virtual machines, resource groups, and other Azure assets for reconnaissance purposes.- Google Cloud Resource Enumeration: The attacker seeks to map the environment and find misconfigured or underutilized resources for exploitation.- Office 365 Service Enumeration: The attacker may look for data repositories or collaboration tools to exfiltrate sensitive information. This data component can be collected through the following measures: Enable Cloud Activity Logging Ensure cloud service logs are enabled for API calls and resource usage. Example: Enable AWS CloudTrail, Azure Monitor, or Google Cloud Logging to track resource queries. Centralize Logs in a SIEM Aggregate logs from cloud control planes into a centralized SIEM (e.g., Splunk, Azure Sentinel). Example: Collect AWS CloudTrail logs and set up alerts for API calls related to service enumeration. Use Native Cloud Security Tools Leverage cloud-native security solutions like AWS GuardDuty, Azure Defender, or Google Security Command Center. Example: Use GuardDuty to detect anomalous API activity, such as ListServices being executed by an unknown user. Implement Network Flow Logging Monitor and analyze VPC flow logs to identify lateral movement or enumeration activity. Example: Inspect flow logs for unexpected traffic between compute instances and the cloud control plane. API Access Monitoring Monitor API keys and tokens used for enumeration to identify misuse or compromise. Example: Use AWS Secrets Manager or Azure Key Vault to manage and rotate keys securely.

This can include benign actions (e.g., hardware drivers) or malicious behavior (e.g., rootkits or unsigned drivers). Examples: Legitimate Driver Loading: A new graphics driver from a vendor like NVIDIA or AMD is loaded into the system. Unsigned Driver Loading: A driver without a valid digital signature is loaded into the kernel. Rootkit Installation: A malicious rootkit driver is loaded to manipulate kernel-mode processes. Anti-Virus or EDR Driver Loading: An Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution loads its driver to monitor system activities. Driver Misuse: A legitimate driver is loaded and exploited to execute malicious actions, such as using vulnerable drivers for bypassing defenses (e.g., Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) attacks). This data component can be collected through the following measures: Windows Sysmon Logs: Event ID 6: Captures driver loading activity, including file path, hashes, and signature information. Configuration: Ensure Sysmon is configured with a ruleset that monitors driver loading events Windows Event Logs: Enable \"Audit Kernel Object\" to capture kernel-related driver loading events. Linux Auditd: Configure audit rules to capture driver loading events: auditctl -w /lib/modules/ -p rwxa -k driver_load Kernel Logs (dmesg): Use dmesg to monitor driver-related activities: dmesg | grep \"module\" Syslog or journald: Review logs for module insertion or removal activities. macOS Unified Logs: Use the macOS unified logging system to monitor kext (kernel extension) loads:log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains \"kext load\"' Endpoint Security Framework: Monitor driver loading via third-party security tools that leverage Apple\u2019s Endpoint Security Framework. SIEM Tools Ingest driver load logs from Sysmon, Auditd, or macOS unified logs into a centralized SIEM (e.g., Splunk).

These calls are essential for interacting with system resources such as memory, files, and hardware, or for performing system-level tasks. Monitoring these calls can provide insight into a process's intent, especially if the process is malicious. Data Collection Measures: Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Tools: Leverage tools to monitor API execution behaviors at the process level. Example: Sysmon Event ID 10 captures API call traces for process access and memory allocation. Process Monitor (ProcMon): Use ProcMon to collect detailed logs of process and API activity. ProcMon can provide granular details on API usage and identify malicious behavior during analysis. Windows Event Logs: Use Event IDs from Windows logs for specific API-related activities: Event ID 4688: A new process has been created (can indirectly infer API use). Event ID 4657: A registry value has been modified (to monitor registry-altering APIs). Dynamic Analysis Tools: Tools like Cuckoo Sandbox, Flare VM, or Hybrid Analysis monitor API execution during malware detonation. Host-Based Logs: On Linux/macOS systems, leverage audit frameworks (e.g., auditd, strace) to capture and analyze system call usage that APIs map to. Runtime Monitors: Runtime security tools like Falco can monitor system-level calls for API execution.

"content": " Logon Session Creation The successful establishment of a new user session following a successful authentication attempt. This typically signifies that a user has provided valid credentials or authentication tokens, and the system has initiated a session associated with that user account. This data is crucial for tracking authentication events and identifying potential unauthorized access. Examples: Windows Systems Event ID: 4624 Logon Type: 2 (Interactive) or 10 (Remote Interactive via RDP). Account Name: JohnDoe Source Network Address: 192.168.1.100 Authentication Package: NTLM Linux Systems /var/log/utmp or /var/log/wtmp: Log format: login user [tty] from [source_ip] User: jane IP: 10.0.0.5 Timestamp: 2024-12-28 08:30:00 macOS Systems /var/log/asl.log or unified logging framework: Log: com.apple.securityd: Authentication succeeded for user 'admin' Cloud Environments Azure Sign-In Logs: Activity: Sign-in successful Client App: Browser Location: Unknown (Country: X) Google Workspace Activity: Login Event Type: successful_login Source IP: 203.0.113.55 This data component can be collected through the following measures: Windows Systems Event Logs: Monitor Security Event Logs using Event ID 4624 for successful logons. PowerShell Example: Get-EventLog -LogName Security -InstanceId 4624 Linux Systems Log Files: Monitor /var/log/utmp, /var/log/wtmp, or /var/log/auth.log for logon events. Tools: Use last or who commands to parse login records. macOS Systems Log Sources: Monitor /var/log/asl.log or Apple Unified Logs using the log show command. Command Example: log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains \"Authentication succeeded\"' --info Cloud Environments Azure AD: Use Azure Monitor to analyze sign-in logs. Example CLI Query: az monitor log-analytics query -w <workspace_id> --analytics-query \"AzureActivity | where ActivityStatus == 'Success' and OperationName == 'Sign-in'\" Google Workspace: Enable and monitor Login Audit logs from the Admin Console. Office 365: Use Audit Log Search in Microsoft 365 Security & Compliance Center for login-related events. Network Logs Sources: Network authentication mechanisms (e.g., RADIUS or TACACS logs). Enable EDR Monitoring: EDR tools monitor logon session activity, including the creation of new sessions. Configure alerts for: Suspicious logon types (e.g., Logon Type 10 for RDP or Type 5 for Service). Logons from unusual locations, accounts, or devices. Leverage EDR telemetry for session attributes like source IP, session duration, and originating process.

"content": " Cloud Storage Deletion Cloud Storage Deletion refers to the removal or destruction of cloud storage infrastructure, such as buckets, containers, or directories, within a cloud environment. Monitoring this activity is critical to detecting potential unauthorized or malicious actions, such as data destruction by adversaries or accidental deletions that may lead to data loss. Examples: AWS S3 Bucket Deletion: An AWS user deletes an S3 bucket using the DeleteBucket API call. Azure Blob Storage Container Deletion: A user deletes a container in Azure Blob Storage using the Delete Container operation. Google Cloud Storage Bucket Deletion: A Google Cloud user deletes a bucket using the storage.buckets.delete API. OpenStack Swift Container Deletion: A user deletes a container in OpenStack Swift using the DELETE method. This data component can be collected through the following measures: Enable Logging for Cloud Storage Services AWS S3: Enable AWS CloudTrail to log DeleteBucket API actions. Azure Blob Storage: Enable Azure Monitor and Diagnostic Logs to capture Delete Container operations. Use Azure Event Grid to capture and trigger alerts for container deletion. Google Cloud Storage: Enable Data Access logs in Cloud Audit Logs to monitor storage.buckets.delete API calls. OpenStack Swift: Configure Swift logging to capture DELETE requests for containers. Centralized Logging and Analysis Use platforms like Splunk or native SIEMs to forward and analyze logs for anomalies in cloud storage deletions.

"content": " File Access To events where a file is opened or accessed, making its contents available to the requester. This includes reading, executing, or interacting with files by authorized or unauthorized entities. Examples include logging file access events (e.g., Windows Event ID 4663), monitoring file reads, and detecting unusual file access patterns. Examples: File Read Operations: A user opens a sensitive document (e.g., financial_report.xlsx) on a shared drive. File Execution: A script or executable file is accessed and executed (e.g., malware.exe is run from a temporary directory). Unauthorized File Access: An unauthorized user attempts to access a protected configuration file (e.g., /etc/passwd on Linux or System32 files on Windows). File Access Patterns: Bulk access to multiple files in a short time (e.g., mass access to documents on a file server). File Access via Network: Files on a network share are accessed remotely (e.g., logs of SMB file access). This data component can be collected through the following measures: Windows Windows Event Logs: Event ID 4663: Captures file system auditing details, including who accessed the file, access type, and file name. Sysmon: Event ID 11: Logs file creation time changes. Event ID 1 (process creation): Can provide insight into files executed. PowerShell: Commands to monitor file access in real-time: Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; ID=4663} Linux Auditd: Monitor file access events using audit rules: auditctl -w /path/to/file -p rwxa -k file_access View logs: ausearch -k file_access Inotify: Use inotify to track file access on Linux: inotifywait -m /path/to/watch -e access macOS Unified Logs: Monitor file access using the macOS Unified Logging System. FSEvents: File System Events can track file accesses: fs_usage | grep open Network Devices SMB/CIFS Logs: Monitor file access over network shares using logs from SMB or CIFS protocol. NAS Logs: Collect logs from network-attached storage systems for file access events. SIEM Integration Collect file access logs from all platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) and centralize in a SIEM for correlation and analysis.

"content": " Drive Modification The alteration of a drive letter, mount point, or other attributes of a data storage device, which could involve reassignment, renaming, permissions changes, or other modifications. Examples: Drive Letter Reassignment: A USB drive previously assigned E:\\ is reassigned to D:\\ on a Windows machine. Mount Point Change: On a Linux system, a mounted storage device at /mnt/external is moved to /mnt/storage. Drive Permission Changes: A shared drive's permissions are modified to allow write access for unauthorized users or processes. Renaming of a Drive: A network drive labeled \"HR_Share\" is renamed to \"Shared_Resources.\" Modification of Cloud-Integrated Drives: A cloud storage mount such as Google Drive is modified to sync only specific folders. This data component can be collected through the following measures: Windows Event Logs Relevant Events: Event ID 98: Indicates changes to a volume (e.g., drive letter reassignment). Event ID 1006: Logs permission modifications or changes to removable storage. Configuration: Enable \"Storage Operational Logs\" in the Event Viewer:Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Storage-Tiering > Operational Linux System Logs Auditd Configuration: Add audit rules to track changes to mounted drives: auditctl -w /mnt/ -p w -k drive_modification Command-Line Monitoring: Use dmesg or journalctl to observe drive modifications. macOS System Logs Unified Logs: Collect mount or drive modification events: log show --info | grep \"Volume modified\" Command-Line Monitoring: Use diskutil to track changes: Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Tools Configure policies in EDR solutions to monitor and log changes to drive configurations or attributes. SIEM Tools Aggregate logs from multiple systems into a centralized platform like Splunk to correlate events and alert on suspicious drive modification activities.
