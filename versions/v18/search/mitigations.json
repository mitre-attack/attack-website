"path": "/mitigations/M1013/index.html",
"content": " Application Developer Guidance Application Developer Guidance focuses on providing developers with the knowledge, tools, and best practices needed to write secure code, reduce vulnerabilities, and implement secure design principles. By integrating security throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC), this mitigation aims to prevent the introduction of exploitable weaknesses in applications, systems, and APIs. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Preventing SQL Injection (Secure Coding Practice): Implementation: Train developers to use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of directly embedding user input into SQL queries. Use Case: A web application accepts user input to search a database. By sanitizing and validating user inputs, developers can prevent attackers from injecting malicious SQL commands. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Mitigation: Implementation: Require developers to implement output encoding for all user-generated content displayed on a web page. Use Case: An e-commerce site allows users to leave product reviews. Properly encoding and escaping user inputs prevents malicious scripts from being executed in other users\u2019 browsers. Secure API Design: Implementation: Train developers to authenticate all API endpoints and avoid exposing sensitive information in API responses. Use Case: A mobile banking application uses APIs for account management. By enforcing token-based authentication for every API call, developers reduce the risk of unauthorized access. Static Code Analysis in the Build Pipeline: Implementation: Incorporate tools into CI/CD pipelines to automatically scan for vulnerabilities during the build process. Use Case: A fintech company integrates static analysis tools to detect hardcoded credentials in their source code before deployment. Threat Modeling in the Design Phase: Implementation: Use frameworks like STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) to assess threats during application design. Use Case: Before launching a customer portal, a SaaS company identifies potential abuse cases, such as session hijacking, and designs mitigations like secure session management. Tools for Implementation: Static Code Analysis Tools: Use tools that can scan for known vulnerabilities in source code. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Use tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP to simulate runtime attacks and identify vulnerabilities. Secure Frameworks: Recommend secure-by-default frameworks (e.g., Django for Python, Spring Security for Java) that enforce security best practices.

"title": "Mitigations - ICS",
"path": "/mitigations/ics/index.html",
"content": " ICS Mitigations Mitigations represent security concepts and classes of technologies that can be used to prevent a technique or sub-technique from being successfully executed. Mitigations: 52 ID Name Description M0801 Access Management Access Management technologies can be used to enforce authorization polices and decisions, especially when existing field devices do not provide sufficient capabilities to support user identification and authentication. These technologies typically utilize an in-line network device or gateway system to prevent access to unauthenticated users, while also integrating with an authentication service to first verify user credentials. M0936 Account Use Policies Configure features related to account use like login attempt lockouts, specific login times, etc. M0915 Active Directory Configuration Configure Active Directory to prevent use of certain techniques; use security identifier (SID) Filtering, etc. M0949 Antivirus/Antimalware Use signatures or heuristics to detect malicious software. Within industrial control environments, antivirus/antimalware installations should be limited to assets that are not involved in critical or real-time operations. To minimize the impact to system availability, all products should first be validated within a representative test environment before deployment to production systems. M0913 Application Developer Guidance This mitigation describes any guidance or training given to developers of applications to avoid introducing security weaknesses that an adversary may be able to take advantage of. M0948 Application Isolation and Sandboxing Restrict the execution of code to a virtual environment on or in-transit to an endpoint system. M0947 Audit Perform audits or scans of systems, permissions, insecure software, insecure configurations, etc. to identify potential weaknesses. Perform periodic integrity checks of the device to validate the correctness of the firmware, software, programs, and configurations. Integrity checks, which typically include cryptographic hashes or digital signatures, should be compared to those obtained at known valid states, especially after events like device reboots, program downloads, or program restarts. M0800 Authorization Enforcement The device or system should restrict read, manipulate, or execute privileges to only authenticated users who require access based on approved security policies. Role-based Access Control (RBAC) schemes can help reduce the overhead of assigning permissions to the large number of devices within an ICS. For example, IEC 62351 provides examples of roles used to support common system operations within the electric power sector , while IEEE 1686 defines standard permissions for users of IEDs. M0946 Boot Integrity Use secure methods to boot a system and verify the integrity of the operating system and loading mechanisms. M0945 Code Signing Enforce binary and application integrity with digital signature verification to prevent untrusted code from executing. M0802 Communication Authenticity When communicating over an untrusted network, utilize secure network protocols that both authenticate the message sender and can verify its integrity. This can be done either through message authentication codes (MACs) or digital signatures, to detect spoofed network messages and unauthorized connections. M0953 Data Backup Take and store data backups from end user systems and critical servers. Ensure backup and storage systems are hardened and kept separate from the corporate network to prevent compromise. Maintain and exercise incident response plans , including the management of 'gold-copy' back-up images and configurations for key systems to enable quick recovery and response from adversarial activities that impact control, view, or availability. M0803 Data Loss Prevention Data Loss Prevention (DLP) technologies can be used to help identify adversarial attempts to exfiltrate operational information, such as engineering plans, trade secrets, recipes, intellectual property, or process telemetry. DLP functionality may be built into other security products such as firewalls or standalone suites running on the network and host-based agents. DLP may be configured to prevent the transfer of information through corporate resources such as email, web, and physical media such as USB for host-based solutions. M0942 Disable or Remove Feature or Program Remove or deny access to unnecessary and potentially vulnerable software to prevent abuse by adversaries. M0808 Encrypt Network Traffic Utilize strong cryptographic techniques and protocols to prevent eavesdropping on network communications. M0941 Encrypt Sensitive Information Protect sensitive data-at-rest with strong encryption. M0938 Execution Prevention Block execution of code on a system through application control, and/or script blocking. M0950 Exploit Protection Use capabilities to detect and block conditions that may lead to or be indicative of a software exploit occurring. M0937 Filter Network Traffic Use network appliances to filter ingress or egress traffic and perform protocol-based filtering. Configure software on endpoints to filter network traffic. Perform inline allow/denylisting of network messages based on the application layer (OSI Layer 7) protocol, especially for automation protocols. Application allowlists are beneficial when there are well-defined communication sequences, types, rates, or patterns needed during expected system operations. Application denylists may be needed if all acceptable communication sequences cannot be defined, but instead a set of known malicious uses can be denied (e.g., excessive communication attempts, shutdown messages, invalid commands). Devices performing these functions are often referred to as deep-packet inspection (DPI) firewalls, context-aware firewalls, or firewalls blocking specific automation/SCADA protocol aware firewalls. M0804 Human User Authentication Require user authentication before allowing access to data or accepting commands to a device. While strong multi-factor authentication is preferable, it is not always feasible within ICS environments. Performing strong user authentication also requires additional security controls and processes which are often the target of related adversarial techniques (e.g., Valid Accounts, Default Credentials). Therefore, associated ATT&CK mitigations should be considered in addition to this, including Multi-factor Authentication, Account Use Policies, Password Policies, User Account Management, Privileged Account Management, and User Account Control. M0935 Limit Access to Resource Over Network Prevent access to file shares, remote access to systems, unnecessary services. Mechanisms to limit access may include use of network concentrators, RDP gateways, etc. M0934 Limit Hardware Installation Block users or groups from installing or using unapproved hardware on systems, including USB devices. M0805 Mechanical Protection Layers Utilize a layered protection design based on physical or mechanical protection systems to prevent damage to property, equipment, human safety, or the environment. Examples include interlocks, rupture disk, release values, etc. M0806 Minimize Wireless Signal Propagation Wireless signals frequently propagate outside of organizational boundaries, which provide opportunities for adversaries to monitor or gain unauthorized access to the wireless network. To minimize this threat, organizations should implement measures to detect, understand, and reduce unnecessary RF propagation. M0816 Mitigation Limited or Not Effective This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventative controls since it is based on the abuse of system features. M0932 Multi-factor Authentication Use two or more pieces of evidence to authenticate to a system; such as username and password in addition to a token from a physical smart card or token generator. Within industrial control environments assets such as low-level controllers, workstations, and HMIs have real-time operational control and safety requirements which may restrict the use of multi-factor. M0807 Network Allowlists Network allowlists can be implemented through either host-based files or system hosts files to specify what connections (e.g., IP address, MAC address, port, protocol) can be made from a device. Allowlist techniques that operate at the application layer (e.g., DNP3, Modbus, HTTP) are addressed in Filter Network Traffic mitigation. M0931 Network Intrusion Prevention Use intrusion detection signatures to block traffic at network boundaries. In industrial control environments, network intrusion prevention should be configured so it will not disrupt protocols and communications responsible for real-time functions related to control or safety. M0930 Network Segmentation Architect sections of the network to isolate critical systems, functions, or resources. Use physical and logical segmentation to prevent access to potentially sensitive systems and information. Use a DMZ to contain any internet-facing services that should not be exposed from the internal network. Restrict network access to only required systems and services. In addition, prevent systems from other networks or business functions (e.g., enterprise) from accessing critical process control systems. For example, in IEC 62443, systems within the same secure level should be grouped into a zone, and access to that zone is restricted by a conduit, or mechanism to restrict data flows between zones by segmenting the network. M0928 Operating System Configuration Make configuration changes related to the operating system or a common feature of the operating system that result in system hardening against techniques. M0809 Operational Information Confidentiality Deploy mechanisms to protect the confidentiality of information related to operational processes, facility locations, device configurations, programs, or databases that may have information that can be used to infer organizational trade-secrets, recipes, and other intellectual property (IP). M0810 Out-of-Band Communications Channel Have alternative methods to support communication requirements during communication failures and data integrity attacks. M0927 Password Policies Set and enforce secure password policies for accounts. M0926 Privileged Account Management Manage the creation, modification, use, and permissions associated to privileged accounts, including SYSTEM and root. M0811 Redundancy of Service Redundancy could be provided for both critical ICS devices and services, such as back-up devices or hot-standbys. M0922 Restrict File and Directory Permissions Restrict access by setting directory and file permissions that are not specific to users or privileged accounts. M0944 Restrict Library Loading Prevent abuse of library loading mechanisms in the operating system and software to load untrusted code by configuring appropriate library loading mechanisms and investigating potential vulnerable software. M0924 Restrict Registry Permissions Restrict the ability to modify certain hives or keys in the Windows Registry. M0921 Restrict Web-Based Content Restrict use of certain websites, block downloads/attachments, block Javascript, restrict browser extensions, etc. M0812 Safety Instrumented Systems Utilize Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) to provide an additional layer of protection to hazard scenarios that may cause property damage. A SIS will typically include sensors, logic solvers, and a final control element that can be used to automatically respond to an hazardous condition . Ensure that all SISs are segmented from operational networks to prevent them from being targeted by additional adversarial behavior. M0954 Software Configuration Implement configuration changes to software (other than the operating system) to mitigate security risks associated with how the software operates. M0813 Software Process and Device Authentication Require the authentication of devices and software processes where appropriate. Devices that connect remotely to other systems should require strong authentication to prevent spoofing of communications. Furthermore, software processes should also require authentication when accessing APIs. M0920 SSL/TLS Inspection Break and inspect SSL/TLS sessions to look at encrypted web traffic for adversary activity. M0814 Static Network Configuration Configure hosts and devices to use static network configurations when possible, protocols that require dynamic discovery/addressing (e.g., ARP, DHCP, DNS) can be used to manipulate network message forwarding and enable various AiTM attacks. This mitigation may not always be usable due to limited device features or challenges introduced with different network configurations. M0817 Supply Chain Management Implement a supply chain management program, including policies and procedures to ensure all devices and components originate from a trusted supplier and are tested to verify their integrity. M0919 Threat Intelligence Program A threat intelligence program helps an organization generate their own threat intelligence information and track trends to inform defensive priorities to mitigate risk. M0951 Update Software Perform regular software updates to mitigate exploitation risk. Software updates may need to be scheduled around operational down times. M0918 User Account Management Manage the creation, modification, use, and permissions associated to user accounts. M0917 User Training Train users to be aware of access or manipulation attempts by an adversary to reduce the risk of successful spearphishing, social engineering, and other techniques that involve user interaction. M0818 Validate Program Inputs Devices and programs designed to interact with control system parameters should validate the format and content of all user inputs and actions to ensure the values are within intended operational ranges. These values should be evaluated and further enforced through the program logic running on the field controller. If a problematic or invalid input is identified, the programs should either utilize a predetermined safe value or enter a known safe state, while also logging or alerting on the event. M0916 Vulnerability Scanning Vulnerability scanning is used to find potentially exploitable software vulnerabilities to remediate them. M0815 Watchdog Timers Utilize watchdog timers to ensure devices can quickly detect whether a system is unresponsive. "

"content": " Active Directory Configuration Implement robust Active Directory (AD) configurations using group policies to secure user accounts, control access, and minimize the attack surface. AD configurations enable centralized control over account settings, logon policies, and permissions, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and lateral movement within the network. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Account Configuration: Implementation: Use domain accounts instead of local accounts to leverage AD\u2019s centralized management, including group policies, auditing, and access control. Use Case: For IT staff managing shared resources, provision domain accounts that allow IT teams to log in centrally, reducing the risk of unmanaged, rogue local accounts on individual machines. Interactive Logon Restrictions: Implementation: Configure group policies to restrict interactive logons (e.g., direct physical or RDP logons) for service accounts or privileged accounts that do not require such access. Use Case: Prevent service accounts, such as SQL Server accounts, from having interactive logon privileges. This reduces the risk of these accounts being leveraged for lateral movement if compromised. Remote Desktop Settings: Implementation: Limit Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access to specific, authorized accounts. Use group policies to enforce this, allowing only necessary users to establish RDP sessions. Use Case: On sensitive servers (e.g., domain controllers or financial databases), restrict RDP access to administrative accounts only, while all other users are denied access. Dedicated Administrative Accounts: Implementation: Create domain-wide administrative accounts that are restricted from interactive logons, designed solely for high-level tasks (e.g., software installation, patching). Use Case: Create separate administrative accounts for different purposes, such as one set of accounts for installations and another for managing repository access. This limits exposure and helps reduce attack vectors. Authentication Silos: Implementation: Configure Authentication Silos in AD, using group policies to create access zones with restrictions based on membership, such as the Protected Users security group. This restricts access to critical accounts and minimizes exposure to potential threats. Use Case: Place high-risk or high-value accounts, such as executive or administrative accounts, in an Authentication Silo with extra controls, limiting their exposure to only necessary systems. This reduces the risk of credential misuse or abuse if these accounts are compromised. Tools for Implementation: Active Directory Group Policies: Use Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) to configure, deploy, and enforce policies across AD environments. PowerShell: Automate account configuration, logon restrictions, and policy application using PowerShell scripts. AD Administrative Center: Manage Authentication Silos and configure high-level policies for critical user groups within AD.

Consider applying SID Filtering to interforest trusts, such as forest trusts and external trusts, to exclude SID-History from requests to access domain resources. SID Filtering ensures that any authentication requests over a trust only contain SIDs of security principals from the trusted domain (i.e preventing the trusted domain from claiming a user has membership in groups outside of the domain). SID Filtering of forest trusts is enabled by default, but may have been disabled in some cases to allow a child domain to transitively access forest trusts. SID Filtering of external trusts is automatically enabled on all created external trusts using Server 2003 or later domain controllers. [1] [2] However note that SID Filtering is not automatically applied to legacy trusts or may have been deliberately disabled to allow inter-domain access to resources. SID Filtering can be applied by: [3] Disabling SIDHistory on forest trusts using the netdom tool (netdom trust /domain: /EnableSIDHistory:no on the domain controller) Applying SID Filter Quarantining to external trusts using the netdom tool (netdom trust /domain: /quarantine:yes on the domain controller) Applying SID Filtering to domain trusts within a single forest is not recommended as it is an unsupported configuration and can cause breaking changes. [3] [4] If a domain within a forest is untrustworthy then it should not be a member of the forest. In this situation it is necessary to first split the trusted and untrusted domains into separate forests where SID Filtering can be applied to an interforest trust Enterprise T1606 .002 Forge Web Credentials: SAML Tokens For containing the impact of a previously forged SAML token, rotate the token-signing AD FS certificate in rapid succession twice, which will invalidate any tokens generated using the previous certificate.[5] Enterprise T1003 OS Credential Dumping Manage the access control list for \"Replicating Directory Changes All\" and other permissions associated with domain controller replication.

This mitigation focuses on leveraging secure boot mechanisms, hardware-rooted trust, and runtime integrity checks to prevent tampering during the boot sequence. It is designed to thwart adversaries attempting to modify system firmware, bootloaders, or critical OS components. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Implementation of Secure Boot: Implementation: Enable UEFI Secure Boot on all systems and configure it to allow only signed bootloaders and operating systems. Use Case: An adversary attempts to replace the system\u2019s bootloader with a malicious version to gain persistence. Secure Boot prevents the untrusted bootloader from executing, halting the attack. Utilization of TPMs: Implementation: Configure systems to use TPM-based attestation for boot integrity, ensuring that any modification to the firmware, bootloader, or OS is detected. Use Case: A compromised firmware component alters the boot sequence. The TPM detects the change and triggers an alert, allowing the organization to respond before further damage. Enable Bootloader Passwords: Implementation: Protect BIOS/UEFI settings with a strong password and limit physical access to devices. Use Case: An attacker with physical access attempts to disable Secure Boot or modify the boot sequence. The password prevents unauthorized changes. Runtime Integrity Monitoring: Implementation: Deploy solutions to verify the integrity of critical files and processes after boot. Use Case: A malware infection modifies kernel modules post-boot.

"path": "/mitigations/enterprise/index.html",
"content": " Enterprise Mitigations Mitigations represent security concepts and classes of technologies that can be used to prevent a technique or sub-technique from being successfully executed. Mitigations: 44 ID Name Description M1036 Account Use Policies Account Use Policies help mitigate unauthorized access by configuring and enforcing rules that govern how and when accounts can be used. These policies include enforcing account lockout mechanisms, restricting login times, and setting inactivity timeouts. Proper configuration of these policies reduces the risk of brute-force attacks, credential theft, and unauthorized access by limiting the opportunities for malicious actors to exploit accounts. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1015 Active Directory Configuration Implement robust Active Directory (AD) configurations using group policies to secure user accounts, control access, and minimize the attack surface. AD configurations enable centralized control over account settings, logon policies, and permissions, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and lateral movement within the network. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1049 Antivirus/Antimalware Antivirus/Antimalware solutions utilize signatures, heuristics, and behavioral analysis to detect, block, and remediate malicious software, including viruses, trojans, ransomware, and spyware. These solutions continuously monitor endpoints and systems for known malicious patterns and suspicious behaviors that indicate compromise. Antivirus/Antimalware software should be deployed across all devices, with automated updates to ensure protection against the latest threats. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1013 Application Developer Guidance Application Developer Guidance focuses on providing developers with the knowledge, tools, and best practices needed to write secure code, reduce vulnerabilities, and implement secure design principles. By integrating security throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC), this mitigation aims to prevent the introduction of exploitable weaknesses in applications, systems, and APIs. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1048 Application Isolation and Sandboxing Application Isolation and Sandboxing refers to the technique of restricting the execution of code to a controlled and isolated environment (e.g., a virtual environment, container, or sandbox). This method prevents potentially malicious code from affecting the rest of the system or network by limiting access to sensitive resources and critical operations. The goal is to contain threats and minimize their impact. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1047 Audit Auditing is the process of recording activity and systematically reviewing and analyzing the activity and system configurations. The primary purpose of auditing is to detect anomalies and identify potential threats or weaknesses in the environment. Proper auditing configurations can also help to meet compliance requirements. The process of auditing encompasses regular analysis of user behaviors and system logs in support of proactive security measures. M1040 Behavior Prevention on Endpoint Behavior Prevention on Endpoint refers to the use of technologies and strategies to detect and block potentially malicious activities by analyzing the behavior of processes, files, API calls, and other endpoint events. Rather than relying solely on known signatures, this approach leverages heuristics, machine learning, and real-time monitoring to identify anomalous patterns indicative of an attack. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1046 Boot Integrity Boot Integrity ensures that a system starts securely by verifying the integrity of its boot process, operating system, and associated components. This mitigation focuses on leveraging secure boot mechanisms, hardware-rooted trust, and runtime integrity checks to prevent tampering during the boot sequence. It is designed to thwart adversaries attempting to modify system firmware, bootloaders, or critical OS components. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1045 Code Signing Code Signing is a security process that ensures the authenticity and integrity of software by digitally signing executables, scripts, and other code artifacts. It prevents untrusted or malicious code from executing by verifying the digital signatures against trusted sources. Code signing protects against tampering, impersonation, and distribution of unauthorized or malicious software, forming a critical defense against supply chain and software exploitation attacks. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1043 Credential Access Protection Credential Access Protection focuses on implementing measures to prevent adversaries from obtaining credentials, such as passwords, hashes, tokens, or keys, that could be used for unauthorized access. This involves restricting access to credential storage mechanisms, hardening configurations to block credential dumping methods, and using monitoring tools to detect suspicious credential-related activity. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1053 Data Backup Data Backup involves taking and securely storing backups of data from end-user systems and critical servers. It ensures that data remains available in the event of system compromise, ransomware attacks, or other disruptions. Backup processes should include hardening backup systems, implementing secure storage solutions, and keeping backups isolated from the corporate network to prevent compromise during active incidents. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1057 Data Loss Prevention Data Loss Prevention (DLP) involves implementing strategies and technologies to identify, categorize, monitor, and control the movement of sensitive data within an organization. This includes protecting data formats indicative of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), intellectual property, or financial data from unauthorized access, transmission, or exfiltration. DLP solutions integrate with network, endpoint, and cloud platforms to enforce security policies and prevent accidental or malicious data leaks. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1042 Disable or Remove Feature or Program Disable or remove unnecessary and potentially vulnerable software, features, or services to reduce the attack surface and prevent abuse by adversaries. This involves identifying software or features that are no longer needed or that could be exploited and ensuring they are either removed or properly disabled. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1055 Do Not Mitigate The Do Not Mitigate category highlights scenarios where attempting to mitigate a specific technique may inadvertently increase the organization's security risk or operational instability. This could happen due to the complexity of the system, the integration of critical processes, or the potential for introducing new vulnerabilities. Instead of direct mitigation, these situations may call for alternative strategies such as detection, monitoring, or response. The Do Not Mitigate category underscores the importance of assessing the trade-offs between mitigation efforts and overall system integrity. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1041 Encrypt Sensitive Information Protect sensitive information at rest, in transit, and during processing by using strong encryption algorithms. Encryption ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data, preventing unauthorized access or tampering. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1039 Environment Variable Permissions Restrict the modification of environment variables to authorized users and processes by enforcing strict permissions and policies. This ensures the integrity of environment variables, preventing adversaries from abusing or altering them for malicious purposes. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1038 Execution Prevention Prevent the execution of unauthorized or malicious code on systems by implementing application control, script blocking, and other execution prevention mechanisms. This ensures that only trusted and authorized code is executed, reducing the risk of malware and unauthorized actions. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1050 Exploit Protection Deploy capabilities that detect, block, and mitigate conditions indicative of software exploits. These capabilities aim to prevent exploitation by addressing vulnerabilities, monitoring anomalous behaviors, and applying exploit-mitigation techniques to harden systems and software. M1037 Filter Network Traffic Employ network appliances and endpoint software to filter ingress, egress, and lateral network traffic. This includes protocol-based filtering, enforcing firewall rules, and blocking or restricting traffic based on predefined conditions to limit adversary movement and data exfiltration. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1035 Limit Access to Resource Over Network Restrict access to network resources, such as file shares, remote systems, and services, to only those users, accounts, or systems with a legitimate business requirement. This can include employing technologies like network concentrators, RDP gateways, and zero-trust network access (ZTNA) models, alongside hardening services and protocols. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1034 Limit Hardware Installation Prevent unauthorized users or groups from installing or using hardware, such as external drives, peripheral devices, or unapproved internal hardware components, by enforcing hardware usage policies and technical controls. This includes disabling USB ports, restricting driver installation, and implementing endpoint security tools to monitor and block unapproved devices. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1033 Limit Software Installation Prevent users or groups from installing unauthorized or unapproved software to reduce the risk of introducing malicious or vulnerable applications. This can be achieved through allowlists, software restriction policies, endpoint management tools, and least privilege access principles. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1032 Multi-factor Authentication Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enhances security by requiring users to provide at least two forms of verification to prove their identity before granting access. These factors typically include: M1031 Network Intrusion Prevention Use intrusion detection signatures to block traffic at network boundaries. M1030 Network Segmentation Network segmentation involves dividing a network into smaller, isolated segments to control and limit the flow of traffic between devices, systems, and applications. By segmenting networks, organizations can reduce the attack surface, restrict lateral movement by adversaries, and protect critical assets from compromise. M1028 Operating System Configuration Operating System Configuration involves adjusting system settings and hardening the default configurations of an operating system (OS) to mitigate adversary exploitation and prevent abuse of system functionality. Proper OS configurations address security vulnerabilities, limit attack surfaces, and ensure robust defense against a wide range of techniques. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1060 Out-of-Band Communications Channel Establish secure out-of-band communication channels to ensure the continuity of critical communications during security incidents, data integrity attacks, or in-network communication failures. Out-of-band communication refers to using an alternative, separate communication path that is not dependent on the potentially compromised primary network infrastructure. This method can include secure messaging apps, encrypted phone lines, satellite communications, or dedicated emergency communication systems. Leveraging these alternative channels reduces the risk of adversaries intercepting, disrupting, or tampering with sensitive communications and helps coordinate an effective incident response. M1027 Password Policies Set and enforce secure password policies for accounts to reduce the likelihood of unauthorized access. Strong password policies include enforcing password complexity, requiring regular password changes, and preventing password reuse. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1056 Pre-compromise Pre-compromise mitigations involve proactive measures and defenses implemented to prevent adversaries from successfully identifying and exploiting weaknesses during the Reconnaissance and Resource Development phases of an attack. These activities focus on reducing an organization's attack surface, identify adversarial preparation efforts, and increase the difficulty for attackers to conduct successful operations. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1026 Privileged Account Management Privileged Account Management focuses on implementing policies, controls, and tools to securely manage privileged accounts (e.g., SYSTEM, root, or administrative accounts). This includes restricting access, limiting the scope of permissions, monitoring privileged account usage, and ensuring accountability through logging and auditing.This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1025 Privileged Process Integrity Privileged Process Integrity focuses on defending highly privileged processes (e.g., system services, antivirus, or authentication processes) from tampering, injection, or compromise by adversaries. These processes often interact with critical components, making them prime targets for techniques like code injection, privilege escalation, and process manipulation. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1029 Remote Data Storage Remote Data Storage focuses on moving critical data, such as security logs and sensitive files, to secure, off-host locations to minimize unauthorized access, tampering, or destruction by adversaries. By leveraging remote storage solutions, organizations enhance the protection of forensic evidence, sensitive information, and monitoring data. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1022 Restrict File and Directory Permissions Restricting file and directory permissions involves setting access controls at the file system level to limit which users, groups, or processes can read, write, or execute files. By configuring permissions appropriately, organizations can reduce the attack surface for adversaries seeking to access sensitive data, plant malicious code, or tamper with system files. M1044 Restrict Library Loading Restricting library loading involves implementing security controls to ensure that only trusted and verified libraries (DLLs, shared objects, etc.) are loaded into processes. Adversaries often abuse Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) Injection, DLL Search Order Hijacking, or LD_PRELOAD mechanisms to execute malicious code by forcing the operating system to load untrusted libraries. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1024 Restrict Registry Permissions Restricting registry permissions involves configuring access control settings for sensitive registry keys and hives to ensure that only authorized users or processes can make modifications. By limiting access, organizations can prevent unauthorized changes that adversaries might use for persistence, privilege escalation, or defense evasion. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1021 Restrict Web-Based Content Restricting web-based content involves enforcing policies and technologies that limit access to potentially malicious websites, unsafe downloads, and unauthorized browser behaviors. This can include URL filtering, download restrictions, script blocking, and extension control to protect against exploitation, phishing, and malware delivery. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1054 Software Configuration Software configuration refers to making security-focused adjustments to the settings of applications, middleware, databases, or other software to mitigate potential threats. These changes help reduce the attack surface, enforce best practices, and protect sensitive data. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1020 SSL/TLS Inspection SSL/TLS inspection involves decrypting encrypted network traffic to examine its content for signs of malicious activity. This capability is crucial for detecting threats that use encryption to evade detection, such as phishing, malware, or data exfiltration. After inspection, the traffic is re-encrypted and forwarded to its destination. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1019 Threat Intelligence Program A Threat Intelligence Program enables organizations to proactively identify, analyze, and act on cyber threats by leveraging internal and external data sources. The program supports decision-making processes, prioritizes defenses, and improves incident response by delivering actionable intelligence tailored to the organization's risk profile and operational environment. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1051 Update Software Software updates ensure systems are protected against known vulnerabilities by applying patches and upgrades provided by vendors. Regular updates reduce the attack surface and prevent adversaries from exploiting known security gaps. This includes patching operating systems, applications, drivers, and firmware. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1052 User Account Control User Account Control (UAC) is a security feature in Microsoft Windows that prevents unauthorized changes to the operating system. UAC prompts users to confirm or provide administrator credentials when an action requires elevated privileges. Proper configuration of UAC reduces the risk of privilege escalation attacks. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1018 User Account Management User Account Management involves implementing and enforcing policies for the lifecycle of user accounts, including creation, modification, and deactivation. Proper account management reduces the attack surface by limiting unauthorized access, managing account privileges, and ensuring accounts are used according to organizational policies. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1017 User Training User Training involves educating employees and contractors on recognizing, reporting, and preventing cyber threats that rely on human interaction, such as phishing, social engineering, and other manipulative techniques. Comprehensive training programs create a human firewall by empowering users to be an active component of the organization's cybersecurity defenses. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1016 Vulnerability Scanning Vulnerability scanning involves the automated or manual assessment of systems, applications, and networks to identify misconfigurations, unpatched software, or other security weaknesses. The process helps prioritize remediation efforts by classifying vulnerabilities based on risk and impact, reducing the likelihood of exploitation by adversaries. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: "

"content": " User Account Management User Account Management involves implementing and enforcing policies for the lifecycle of user accounts, including creation, modification, and deactivation. Proper account management reduces the attack surface by limiting unauthorized access, managing account privileges, and ensuring accounts are used according to organizational policies. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Enforcing the Principle of Least Privilege Implementation: Assign users only the minimum permissions required to perform their job functions. Regularly audit accounts to ensure no excess permissions are granted. Use Case: Reduces the risk of privilege escalation by ensuring accounts cannot perform unauthorized actions. Implementing Strong Password Policies Implementation: Enforce password complexity requirements (e.g., length, character types). Require password expiration every 90 days and disallow password reuse. Use Case: Prevents adversaries from gaining unauthorized access through password guessing or brute force attacks. Managing Dormant and Orphaned Accounts Implementation: Implement automated workflows to disable accounts after a set period of inactivity (e.g., 30 days). Remove orphaned accounts (e.g., accounts without an assigned owner) during regular account audits. Use Case: Eliminates dormant accounts that could be exploited by attackers. Account Lockout Policies Implementation: Configure account lockout thresholds (e.g., lock accounts after five failed login attempts). Set lockout durations to a minimum of 15 minutes. Use Case: Mitigates automated attack techniques that rely on repeated login attempts. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for High-Risk Accounts Implementation: Require MFA for all administrative accounts and high-risk users. Use MFA mechanisms like hardware tokens, authenticator apps, or biometrics. Use Case: Prevents unauthorized access, even if credentials are stolen. Restricting Interactive Logins Implementation: Restrict interactive logins for privileged accounts to specific secure systems or management consoles. Use group policies to enforce logon restrictions. Use Case: Protects sensitive accounts from misuse or exploitation. Tools for Implementation Built-in Tools: Microsoft Active Directory (AD): Centralized account management and RBAC enforcement.

"content": " Out-of-Band Communications Channel Establish secure out-of-band communication channels to ensure the continuity of critical communications during security incidents, data integrity attacks, or in-network communication failures. Out-of-band communication refers to using an alternative, separate communication path that is not dependent on the potentially compromised primary network infrastructure. This method can include secure messaging apps, encrypted phone lines, satellite communications, or dedicated emergency communication systems. Leveraging these alternative channels reduces the risk of adversaries intercepting, disrupting, or tampering with sensitive communications and helps coordinate an effective incident response.[1][2] ID: M1060 Version: 1.0 Created: 30 August 2024 Last Modified: 12 October 2024 Version Permalink Live Version Techniques Addressed by Mitigation Domain ID Name Use Enterprise T1213 Data from Information Repositories Create plans for leveraging a secure out-of-band communications channel, rather than existing in-network chat applications, in case of a security incident.[1] .005 Messaging Applications Implement secure out-of-band communication channels to use as an alternative to in-network chat applications during a security incident.

"title": "Filter Network Traffic, Mitigation M1037 - Enterprise",
"path": "/mitigations/M1037/index.html",
"content": " Filter Network Traffic Employ network appliances and endpoint software to filter ingress, egress, and lateral network traffic. This includes protocol-based filtering, enforcing firewall rules, and blocking or restricting traffic based on predefined conditions to limit adversary movement and data exfiltration. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Ingress Traffic Filtering: Use Case: Configure network firewalls to allow traffic only from authorized IP addresses to public-facing servers. Implementation: Limit SSH (port 22) and RDP (port 3389) traffic to specific IP ranges. Egress Traffic Filtering: Use Case: Use firewalls or endpoint security software to block unauthorized outbound traffic to prevent data exfiltration and command-and-control (C2) communications. Implementation: Block outbound traffic to known malicious IPs or regions where communication is unexpected. Protocol-Based Filtering: Use Case: Restrict the use of specific protocols that are commonly abused by adversaries, such as SMB, RPC, or Telnet, based on business needs. Implementation: Disable SMBv1 on endpoints to prevent exploits like EternalBlue. Network Segmentation: Use Case: Create network segments for critical systems and restrict communication between segments unless explicitly authorized. Implementation: Implement VLANs to isolate IoT devices or guest networks from core business systems. Application Layer Filtering: Use Case: Use proxy servers or Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to inspect and block malicious HTTP/S traffic. Implementation: Configure a WAF to block SQL injection attempts or other web application exploitation techniques. ID: M1037 Version: 1.2 Created: 11 June 2019 Last Modified: 11 December 2024 Version Permalink Live Version Techniques Addressed by Mitigation Domain ID Name Use Enterprise T1557 Adversary-in-the-Middle Use network appliances and host-based security software to block network traffic that is not necessary within the environment, such as legacy protocols that may be leveraged for AiTM conditions. .001 LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay Use host-based security software to block LLMNR/NetBIOS traffic. Enabling SMB Signing can stop NTLMv2 relay attacks.[1][2][3] .002 ARP Cache Poisoning Consider enabling DHCP Snooping and Dynamic ARP Inspection on switches to create mappings between IP addresses requested via DHCP and ARP tables and tie the values to a port on the switch that may block bogus traffic.[4][5] .003 DHCP Spoofing Consider filtering DHCP traffic on ports 67 and 68 to/from unknown or untrusted DHCP servers. Additionally, port security may also be enabled on layer switches. Furthermore, consider enabling DHCP snooping on layer 2 switches as it will prevent DHCP spoofing attacks and starvation attacks. Consider tracking available IP addresses through a script or a tool. Additionally, block DHCPv6 traffic and incoming router advertisements, especially if IPv6 is not commonly used in the network.[6] Enterprise T1071 Application Layer Protocol Use network appliances to filter ingress or egress traffic and perform protocol-based filtering. Configure software on endpoints to filter network traffic. .001 Web Protocols Restrict and monitor outbound web traffic (HTTP/HTTPS) from critical servers to only approved destinations. Limiting the ability to initiate outbound HTTP/HTTPS connections, especially from public-facing servers, can prevent attackers from using tools like curl or wget to communicate with external C2 servers or download malicious payloads. .002 File Transfer Protocols Filter outbound FTP/SFTP traffic from sensitive systems, allowing file transfers only to trusted internal or known IP addresses. This measure can prevent attackers from transferring data or payloads via FTP/SFTP channels to or from unauthorized external systems. .003 Mail Protocols Limit the ability of servers and critical systems to initiate outbound email communications. Filtering SMTP/IMAP/POP3 traffic to only trusted mail servers reduces the risk of attackers using compromised systems to exfiltrate data via email or to receive commands from attacker-controlled email accounts. .004 DNS Consider filtering DNS requests to unknown, untrusted, or known bad domains and resources. Resolving DNS requests with on-premise/proxy servers may also disrupt adversary attempts to conceal data within DNS packets. .005 Publish/Subscribe Protocols Consider filtering publish/subscribe protocol requests to untrusted or known bad resources over irregular ports (e.g. MQTT\u2019s standard ports are 1883 or 8883). Enterprise T1197 BITS Jobs Modify network and/or host firewall rules, as well as other network controls, to only allow legitimate BITS traffic.

"content": " Execution Prevention Prevent the execution of unauthorized or malicious code on systems by implementing application control, script blocking, and other execution prevention mechanisms. This ensures that only trusted and authorized code is executed, reducing the risk of malware and unauthorized actions. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Application Control: Use Case: Use tools like AppLocker or Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) to create whitelists of authorized applications and block unauthorized ones. On Linux, use tools like SELinux or AppArmor to define mandatory access control policies for application execution. Implementation: Allow only digitally signed or pre-approved applications to execute on servers and endpoints. (e.g., New-AppLockerPolicy -PolicyType Enforced -FilePath \"C:\\Policies\\AppLocker.xml\") Script Blocking: Use Case: Use script control mechanisms to block unauthorized execution of scripts, such as PowerShell or JavaScript. Web Browsers: Use browser extensions or settings to block JavaScript execution from untrusted sources. Implementation: Configure PowerShell to enforce Constrained Language Mode for non-administrator users. (e.g., Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned) Executable Blocking: Use Case: Prevent execution of binaries from suspicious locations, such as %TEMP% or %APPDATA% directories. Implementation: Block execution of .exe, .bat, or .ps1 files from user-writable directories. Dynamic Analysis Prevention:- Use Case: Use behavior-based execution prevention tools to identify and block malicious activity in real time.- Implemenation: Employ EDR solutions that analyze runtime behavior and block suspicious code execution.

"content": " Multi-factor Authentication Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enhances security by requiring users to provide at least two forms of verification to prove their identity before granting access. These factors typically include: Something you know: Passwords, PINs. Something you have: Physical tokens, smartphone authenticator apps. Something you are: Biometric data such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or retinal scans. Implementing MFA across all critical systems and services ensures robust protection against account takeover and unauthorized access. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Identity and Access Management (IAM): Use IAM solutions like Azure Active Directory, Okta, or AWS IAM to enforce MFA policies for all user logins, especially for privileged roles. Enable conditional access policies to enforce MFA for risky sign-ins (e.g., unfamiliar devices, geolocations). Enable Conditional Access policies to only allow logins from trusted devices, such as those enrolled in Intune or joined via Hybrid/Entra. Authentication Tools and Methods: Use authenticator applications such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or Authy for time-based one-time passwords (TOTP). Deploy hardware-based tokens like YubiKey, RSA SecurID, or smart cards for additional security. Enforce biometric authentication for compatible devices and applications. Secure Legacy Systems: Integrate MFA solutions with older systems using third-party tools like Duo Security or Thales SafeNet. Enable RADIUS/NPS servers to facilitate MFA for VPNs, RDP, and other network logins. Monitoring and Alerting: Use SIEM tools to monitor failed MFA attempts, login anomalies, or brute-force attempts against MFA systems. Implement alerts for suspicious MFA activities, such as repeated failed codes or new device registrations. Training and Policy Enforcement: Educate employees on the importance of MFA and secure authenticator usage. Enforce policies that require MFA on all critical systems, especially for remote access, privileged accounts, and cloud applications.

Enterprise T1485 Data Destruction Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) delete for cloud storage resources, such as AWS S3 buckets, to prevent unauthorized deletion of critical data and infrastructure. MFA delete requires additional authentication steps, making it significantly more difficult for adversaries to destroy data without proper credentials. This additional security layer helps protect against the impact of data destruction in cloud environments by ensuring that only authenticated actions can irreversibly delete storage or machine images. Enterprise T1530 Data from Cloud Storage Consider using multi-factor authentication to restrict access to resources and cloud storage APIs.[5] Enterprise T1213 Data from Information Repositories Use two or more pieces of evidence to authenticate to a system; such as username and password in addition to a token from a physical smart card or token generator. .003 Code Repositories Use multi-factor authentication for logons to code repositories. Enterprise T1114 Email Collection Use of multi-factor authentication for public-facing webmail servers is a recommended best practice to minimize the usefulness of usernames and passwords to adversaries. .002 Remote Email Collection Use of multi-factor authentication for public-facing webmail servers is a recommended best practice to minimize the usefulness of usernames and passwords to adversaries. Enterprise T1133 External Remote Services Use strong two-factor or multi-factor authentication for remote service accounts to mitigate an adversary's ability to leverage stolen credentials, but be aware of Multi-Factor Authentication Interception techniques for some two-factor authentication implementations. Enterprise T1556 Modify Authentication Process Integrating multi-factor authentication (MFA) as part of organizational policy can greatly reduce the risk of an adversary gaining control of valid credentials that may be used for additional tactics such as initial access, lateral movement, and collecting information. MFA can also be used to restrict access to cloud resources and APIs. .001 Domain Controller Authentication Integrating multi-factor authentication (MFA) as part of organizational policy can greatly reduce the risk of an adversary gaining control of valid credentials that may be used for additional tactics such as initial access, lateral movement, and collecting information. MFA can also be used to restrict access to cloud resources and APIs. .003 Pluggable Authentication Modules Integrating multi-factor authentication (MFA) as part of organizational policy can greatly reduce the risk of an adversary gaining control of valid credentials that may be used for additional tactics such as initial access, lateral movement, and collecting information. .004 Network Device Authentication Use multi-factor authentication for user and privileged accounts. Most embedded network devices support TACACS+ and/or RADIUS. Follow vendor prescribed best practices for hardening access control. [6] .006 Multi-Factor Authentication Ensure that MFA and MFA policies and requirements are properly implemented for existing and deactivated or dormant accounts and devices. If possible, consider configuring MFA solutions to \"fail closed\" rather than grant access in case of serious errors. .007 Hybrid Identity Integrating multi-factor authentication (MFA) as part of organizational policy can greatly reduce the risk of an adversary gaining control of valid credentials that may be used for additional tactics such as initial access, lateral movement, and collecting information. MFA can also be used to restrict access to cloud resources and APIs. Enterprise T1601 Modify System Image Use multi-factor authentication for user and privileged accounts. Most embedded network devices support TACACS+ and/or RADIUS. Follow vendor prescribed best practices for hardening access control.[6] .001 Patch System Image Use multi-factor authentication for user and privileged accounts.

Follow vendor prescribed best practices for hardening access control.[6] Enterprise T1621 Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation Implement more secure 2FA/MFA mechanisms in replacement of simple push or one-click 2FA/MFA options. For example, having users enter a one-time code provided by the login screen into the 2FA/MFA application or utilizing other out-of-band 2FA/MFA mechanisms (such as rotating code-based hardware tokens providing rotating codes that need an accompanying user pin) may be more secure. Furthermore, change default configurations and implement limits upon the maximum number of 2FA/MFA request prompts that can be sent to users in period of time.[7] Enterprise T1599 Network Boundary Bridging Use multi-factor authentication for user and privileged accounts. Most embedded network devices support TACACS+ and/or RADIUS. Follow vendor prescribed best practices for hardening access control.[6] .001 Network Address Translation Traversal Use multi-factor authentication for user and privileged accounts. Most embedded network devices support TACACS+ and/or RADIUS. Follow vendor prescribed best practices for hardening access control.

Enterprise T1072 Software Deployment Tools Ensure proper system and access isolation for critical network systems through use of multi-factor authentication. Enterprise T1539 Steal Web Session Cookie Deploy hardware-based token (e.g., YubiKey or FIDO key), which incorporates the target login domain as part of the negotiation protocol, will prevent session cookie theft through proxy methods. Implement Conditional Access policies to only allow logins from trusted devices, such as those enrolled in Intune or joined via Hybrid/Entra. This mitigates the risk of session cookie replay attacks by ensuring that stolen tokens cannot be reused on unauthorized devices. Enterprise T1199 Trusted Relationship Require MFA for all delegated administrator accounts.[9] Enterprise T1078 Valid Accounts Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all account types, including default, local, domain, and cloud accounts, to prevent unauthorized access, even if credentials are compromised. MFA provides a critical layer of security by requiring multiple forms of verification beyond just a password. This measure significantly reduces the risk of adversaries abusing valid accounts to gain initial access, escalate privileges, maintain persistence, or evade defenses within your network. .001 Default Accounts Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for default accounts whenever possible to prevent unauthorized access, even if credentials for these accounts are compromised. MFA adds an additional layer of security that requires more than just a username and password, making it significantly harder for adversaries to exploit these accounts for initial access or lateral movement. .002 Domain Accounts Integrating multi-factor authentication (MFA) as part of organizational policy can greatly reduce the risk of an adversary gaining control of valid credentials that may be used for additional tactics such as initial access, lateral movement, and collecting information. MFA can also be used to restrict access to cloud resources and APIs. .003 Local Accounts Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for local accounts to add an extra layer of protection against credential theft and misuse. MFA can be implemented using methods like mobile-based authenticators or hardware tokens, even in environments that do not rely on domain controllers or cloud services. This additional security measure can help reduce the risk of adversaries gaining unauthorized access to local systems and resources. .004 Cloud Accounts Use multi-factor authentication for cloud accounts, especially privileged accounts. This can be implemented in a variety of forms (e.g. hardware, virtual, SMS), and can also be audited using administrative reporting features.[10] Enterprise T1669 Wi-Fi Networks Harden access requirements for Wi-Fi networks through using two or more pieces of evidence to authenticate, such as a username and password in addition to a token from a physical smart card or token generator.

"content": " Restrict File and Directory Permissions Restricting file and directory permissions involves setting access controls at the file system level to limit which users, groups, or processes can read, write, or execute files. By configuring permissions appropriately, organizations can reduce the attack surface for adversaries seeking to access sensitive data, plant malicious code, or tamper with system files. Enforce Least Privilege Permissions: Remove unnecessary write permissions on sensitive files and directories. Use file ownership and groups to control access for specific roles. Example (Windows): Right-click the shared folder \u2192 Properties \u2192 Security tab \u2192 Adjust permissions for NTFS ACLs. Harden File Shares: Disable anonymous access to shared folders. Enforce NTFS permissions for shared folders on Windows. Example: Set permissions to restrict write access to critical files, such as system executables (e.g., /bin or /sbin on Linux). Use tools like chown and chmod to assign file ownership and limit access. On Linux, apply:chmod 750 /etc/sensitive.confchown root:admin /etc/sensitive.conf File Integrity Monitoring (FIM): Use tools like Tripwire, Wazuh, or OSSEC to monitor changes to critical file permissions. Audit File System Access: Enable auditing to track permission changes or unauthorized access attempts. Use auditd (Linux) or Event Viewer (Windows) to log activities. Restrict Startup Directories: Configure permissions to prevent unauthorized writes to directories like C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu. Example: Restrict write access to critical directories like /etc/, /usr/local/, and Windows directories such as C:\\Windows\\System32. On Windows, use icacls to modify permissions: icacls \"C:\\Windows\\System32\" /inheritance:r /grant:r SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)F On Linux, monitor permissions using tools like lsattr or auditd.

Malware researchers can reverse engineer malware variants that use DGAs and determine future domains that the malware will attempt to contact, but this is a time and resource intensive effort.[5][6] Malware is also increasingly incorporating seed values that can be unique for each instance, which would then need to be determined to extract future generated domains. In some cases, the seed that a particular sample uses can be extracted from DNS traffic.[7] Even so, there can be thousands of possible domains generated per day; this makes it impractical for defenders to preemptively register all possible C2 domains due to the cost.

"path": "/mitigations/M1048/index.html",
"content": " Application Isolation and Sandboxing Application Isolation and Sandboxing refers to the technique of restricting the execution of code to a controlled and isolated environment (e.g., a virtual environment, container, or sandbox). This method prevents potentially malicious code from affecting the rest of the system or network by limiting access to sensitive resources and critical operations. The goal is to contain threats and minimize their impact. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Browser Sandboxing: Use Case: Implement browser sandboxing to isolate untrusted web content and prevent malicious web pages or scripts from accessing sensitive system resources or initiating unauthorized downloads. Implementation: Use browsers with built-in sandboxing features (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge) or deploy enhanced browser security frameworks that limit the execution scope of active content. Consider controls that monitor or restrict script-based file generation and downloads commonly abused in evasion techniques like HTML smuggling. Application Virtualization: Use Case: Deploy critical or high-risk applications in a virtualized environment to ensure any compromise does not affect the host system. Implementation: Use application virtualization platforms to run applications in isolated environments. Email Attachment Sandboxing: Use Case: Route email attachments to a sandbox environment to detect and block malware before delivering emails to end-users. Implementation: Integrate security solutions with sandbox capabilities to analyze email attachments. Endpoint Sandboxing: Use Case: Run all downloaded files and applications in a restricted environment to monitor their behavior for malicious activity. Implementation: Use endpoint protection tools for sandboxing at the endpoint level.

"content": " Pre-compromise Pre-compromise mitigations involve proactive measures and defenses implemented to prevent adversaries from successfully identifying and exploiting weaknesses during the Reconnaissance and Resource Development phases of an attack. These activities focus on reducing an organization's attack surface, identify adversarial preparation efforts, and increase the difficulty for attackers to conduct successful operations. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Limit Information Exposure: Regularly audit and sanitize publicly available data, including job posts, websites, and social media. Use tools like OSINT monitoring platforms (e.g., SpiderFoot, Recon-ng) to identify leaked information. Protect Domain and DNS Infrastructure: Enable DNSSEC and use WHOIS privacy protection. Monitor for domain hijacking or lookalike domains using services like RiskIQ or DomainTools. External Monitoring: Use tools like Shodan, Censys to monitor your external attack surface. Deploy external vulnerability scanners to proactively address weaknesses. Threat Intelligence: Leverage platforms like MISP, Recorded Future, or Anomali to track adversarial infrastructure, tools, and activity. Content and Email Protections: Use email security solutions like Proofpoint, Microsoft Defender for Office 365, or Mimecast. Enforce SPF/DKIM/DMARC policies to protect against email spoofing.

"content": " Antivirus/Antimalware Antivirus/Antimalware solutions utilize signatures, heuristics, and behavioral analysis to detect, block, and remediate malicious software, including viruses, trojans, ransomware, and spyware. These solutions continuously monitor endpoints and systems for known malicious patterns and suspicious behaviors that indicate compromise. Antivirus/Antimalware software should be deployed across all devices, with automated updates to ensure protection against the latest threats. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Signature-Based Detection: Implementation: Use predefined signatures to identify known malware based on unique patterns such as file hashes, byte sequences, or command-line arguments. This method is effective against known threats. Use Case: When malware like \"Emotet\" is detected, its signature (such as a specific file hash) matches a known database of malicious software, triggering an alert and allowing immediate quarantine of the infected file. Heuristic-Based Detection: Implementation: Deploy heuristic algorithms that analyze behavior and characteristics of files and processes to identify potential malware, even if it doesn\u2019t match a known signature. Use Case: If a program attempts to modify multiple critical system files or initiate suspicious network communications, heuristic analysis may flag it as potentially malicious, even if no specific malware signature is available. Behavioral Detection (Behavior Prevention): Implementation: Use behavioral analysis to detect patterns of abnormal activities, such as unusual system calls, unauthorized file encryption, or attempts to escalate privileges. Use Case: Behavioral analysis can detect ransomware attacks early by identifying behavior like mass file encryption, even before a specific ransomware signature has been identified. Real-Time Scanning: Implementation: Enable real-time scanning to automatically inspect files and network traffic for signs of malware as they are accessed, downloaded, or executed. Use Case: When a user downloads an email attachment, the antivirus solution scans the file in real-time, checking it against both signatures and heuristics to detect any malicious content before it can be opened. Cloud-Assisted Threat Intelligence: Implementation: Use cloud-based threat intelligence to ensure the antivirus solution can access the latest malware definitions and real-time threat feeds from a global database of emerging threats. Use Case: Cloud-assisted antivirus solutions quickly identify newly discovered malware by cross-referencing against global threat databases, providing real-time protection against zero-day attacks. Tools for Implementation: Endpoint Security Platforms: Use solutions such as EDR for comprehensive antivirus/antimalware protection across all systems. Centralized Management: Implement centralized antivirus management consoles that provide visibility into threat activity, enable policy enforcement, and automate updates. Behavioral Analysis Tools: Leverage solutions with advanced behavioral analysis capabilities to detect malicious activity patterns that don\u2019t rely on known signatures.

"path": "/mitigations/M1043/index.html",
"content": " Credential Access Protection Credential Access Protection focuses on implementing measures to prevent adversaries from obtaining credentials, such as passwords, hashes, tokens, or keys, that could be used for unauthorized access. This involves restricting access to credential storage mechanisms, hardening configurations to block credential dumping methods, and using monitoring tools to detect suspicious credential-related activity. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Restrict Access to Credential Storage: Use Case: Prevent adversaries from accessing the SAM (Security Account Manager) database on Windows systems. Implementation: Enforce least privilege principles and restrict administrative access to credential stores such as C:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\SAM. Use Credential Guard: Use Case: Isolate LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) memory to prevent credential dumping. Implementation: Enable Windows Defender Credential Guard on enterprise endpoints to isolate secrets and protect them from unauthorized access. Monitor for Credential Dumping Tools: Use Case: Detect and block known tools like Mimikatz or Windows Credential Editor. Implementation: Flag suspicious process behavior related to credential dumping. Disable Cached Credentials: Use Case: Prevent adversaries from exploiting cached credentials on endpoints. Implementation: Configure group policy to reduce or eliminate the use of cached credentials (e.g., set Interactive logon: Number of previous logons to cache to 0). Enable Secure Boot and Memory Protections: Use Case: Prevent memory-based attacks used to extract credentials. Implementation: Configure Secure Boot and enforce hardware-based security features like DEP (Data Execution Prevention) and ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization).

"content": " Vulnerability Scanning Vulnerability scanning involves the automated or manual assessment of systems, applications, and networks to identify misconfigurations, unpatched software, or other security weaknesses. The process helps prioritize remediation efforts by classifying vulnerabilities based on risk and impact, reducing the likelihood of exploitation by adversaries. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Proactive Identification of Vulnerabilities Implementation: Use tools like Nessus or OpenVAS to scan endpoints, servers, and applications for missing patches and configuration issues. Schedule regular scans to ensure timely identification of vulnerabilities introduced by new deployments or updates. Use Case: A scan identifies unpatched software, such as outdated Apache servers, which could be exploited via CVE-XXXX-XXXX. The server is promptly patched, mitigating the risk. Cloud Environment Scanning Implementation: Use cloud-specific vulnerability management tools like AWS Inspector, Azure Security Center, or GCP Security Command Center to identify issues like open S3 buckets or overly permissive IAM roles. Use Case: The scan detects a misconfigured S3 bucket with public read access, which is remediated to prevent potential data leakage. Network Device Scanning Implementation: Use tools to scan network devices for vulnerabilities, such as weak SNMP strings or outdated firmware. Correlate scan results with vendor advisories to prioritize updates. Use Case: Scanning detects a router running outdated firmware vulnerable to CVE-XXXX-YYYY. The firmware is updated to a secure version. Web Application Scanning Implementation: Use dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools such as OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite to scan for common vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS). Perform regular scans post-deployment to identify newly introduced vulnerabilities. Use Case: A scan identifies a cross-site scripting vulnerability in a form input field, which is promptly remediated by developers. Prioritizing Vulnerabilities Implementation: Use vulnerability scoring frameworks like CVSS to assess severity.Integrate vulnerability scanning tools with ticketing systems to assign remediation tasks based on criticality. Use Case: A critical vulnerability with a CVSS score of 9.8 affecting remote access servers is prioritized and patched first.

"title": "Audit, Mitigation M1047 - Enterprise",
"path": "/mitigations/M1047/index.html",
"content": " Audit Auditing is the process of recording activity and systematically reviewing and analyzing the activity and system configurations. The primary purpose of auditing is to detect anomalies and identify potential threats or weaknesses in the environment. Proper auditing configurations can also help to meet compliance requirements. The process of auditing encompasses regular analysis of user behaviors and system logs in support of proactive security measures. Auditing is applicable to all systems used within an organization, from the front door of a building to accessing a file on a fileserver. It is considered more critical for regulated industries such as, healthcare, finance and government where compliance requirements demand stringent tracking of user and system activates.This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: System Audit: Use Case: Regularly assess system configurations to ensure compliance with organizational security policies. Implementation: Use tools to scan for deviations from established benchmarks. Permission Audits: Use Case: Review file and folder permissions to minimize the risk of unauthorized access or privilege escalation. Implementation: Run access reviews to identify users or groups with excessive permissions. Software Audits: Use Case: Identify outdated, unsupported, or insecure software that could serve as an attack vector. Implementation: Use inventory and vulnerability scanning tools to detect outdated versions and recommend secure alternatives. Configuration Audits: Use Case: Evaluate system and network configurations to ensure secure settings (e.g., disabled SMBv1, enabled MFA). Implementation: Implement automated configuration scanning tools like SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) to identify non-compliant systems. Network Audits: Use Case: Examine network traffic, firewall rules, and endpoint communications to identify unauthorized or insecure connections. Implementation: Utilize tools such as Wireshark, or Zeek to monitor and log suspicious network behavior.

"title": "Account Use Policies, Mitigation M1036 - Enterprise",
"path": "/mitigations/M1036/index.html",
"content": " Account Use Policies Account Use Policies help mitigate unauthorized access by configuring and enforcing rules that govern how and when accounts can be used. These policies include enforcing account lockout mechanisms, restricting login times, and setting inactivity timeouts. Proper configuration of these policies reduces the risk of brute-force attacks, credential theft, and unauthorized access by limiting the opportunities for malicious actors to exploit accounts. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Account Lockout Policies: Implementation: Configure account lockout settings so that after a defined number of failed login attempts (e.g., 3-5 attempts), the account is locked for a specific time period (e.g., 15 minutes) or requires an administrator to unlock it. Use Case: This prevents brute-force attacks by limiting how many incorrect password attempts can be made before the account is temporarily disabled, reducing the likelihood of an attacker successfully guessing a password. Login Time Restrictions: Implementation: Set up login time policies to restrict when users or groups can log into systems. For example, only allowing login during standard business hours (e.g., 8 AM to 6 PM) for non-administrative accounts. Use Case: This prevents unauthorized access outside of approved working hours, where login attempts might be more suspicious or harder to monitor. For example, if an account that is only supposed to be active during the day logs in at 2 AM, it should raise an alert or be blocked. Inactivity Timeout and Session Termination: Implementation: Enforce session timeouts after a period of inactivity (e.g., 10-15 minutes) and require users to re-authenticate if they wish to resume the session. Use Case: This policy prevents attackers from hijacking active sessions left unattended. For example, if an employee walks away from their computer without locking it, an attacker with physical access to the system would be unable to exploit the session. Password Aging Policies: Implementation: Enforce password aging rules, requiring users to change their passwords after a defined period (e.g., 90 days) and ensure passwords are not reused by maintaining a password history. Use Case: This limits the risk of compromised passwords being used indefinitely. Regular password changes make it more difficult for attackers to reuse stolen credentials. Account Expiration and Deactivation: Implementation: Configure user accounts, especially for temporary or contract workers, to automatically expire after a set date or event. Accounts that remain unused for a specific period should be deactivated automatically. Use Case: This prevents dormant accounts from becoming an attack vector. For example, an attacker can exploit unused accounts if they are not properly monitored or deactivated. Tools for Implementation: Group Policy Objects (GPOs) in Windows: To enforce account lockout thresholds, login time restrictions, session timeouts, and password policies. Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions: For centralized management of user accounts, session policies, and automated deactivation of accounts. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms: To monitor and alert on unusual login activity, such as failed logins or out-of-hours access attempts. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Tools: To further enforce secure login attempts, preventing brute-force or credential stuffing attacks.

"path": "/mitigations/M1030/index.html",
"content": " Network Segmentation Network segmentation involves dividing a network into smaller, isolated segments to control and limit the flow of traffic between devices, systems, and applications. By segmenting networks, organizations can reduce the attack surface, restrict lateral movement by adversaries, and protect critical assets from compromise. Effective network segmentation leverages a combination of physical boundaries, logical separation through VLANs, and access control policies enforced by network appliances like firewalls, routers, and cloud-based configurations. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Segment Critical Systems: Identify and group systems based on their function, sensitivity, and risk. Examples include payment systems, HR databases, production systems, and internet-facing servers. Use VLANs, firewalls, or routers to enforce logical separation. Implement DMZ for Public-Facing Services: Host web servers, DNS servers, and email servers in a DMZ to limit their access to internal systems. Apply strict firewall rules to filter traffic between the DMZ and internal networks. Use Cloud-Based Segmentation: In cloud environments, use VPCs, subnets, and security groups to isolate applications and enforce traffic rules. Apply AWS Transit Gateway or Azure VNet peering for controlled connectivity between cloud segments. Apply Microsegmentation for Workloads: Use software-defined networking (SDN) tools to implement workload-level segmentation and prevent lateral movement. Restrict Traffic with ACLs and Firewalls: Apply Access Control Lists (ACLs) to network devices to enforce \"deny by default\" policies. Use firewalls to restrict both north-south (external-internal) and east-west (internal-internal) traffic. Monitor and Audit Segmented Networks: Regularly review firewall rules, ACLs, and segmentation policies. Monitor network flows for anomalies to ensure segmentation is effective. Test Segmentation Effectiveness: Perform periodic penetration tests to verify that unauthorized access is blocked between network segments.

"title": "Behavior Prevention on Endpoint, Mitigation M1040 - Enterprise",
"path": "/mitigations/M1040/index.html",
"content": " Behavior Prevention on Endpoint Behavior Prevention on Endpoint refers to the use of technologies and strategies to detect and block potentially malicious activities by analyzing the behavior of processes, files, API calls, and other endpoint events. Rather than relying solely on known signatures, this approach leverages heuristics, machine learning, and real-time monitoring to identify anomalous patterns indicative of an attack. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Suspicious Process Behavior: Implementation: Use Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools to monitor and block processes exhibiting unusual behavior, such as privilege escalation attempts. Use Case: An attacker uses a known vulnerability to spawn a privileged process from a user-level application. The endpoint tool detects the abnormal parent-child process relationship and blocks the action. Unauthorized File Access: Implementation: Leverage Data Loss Prevention (DLP) or endpoint tools to block processes attempting to access sensitive files without proper authorization. Use Case: A process tries to read or modify a sensitive file located in a restricted directory, such as /etc/shadow on Linux or the SAM registry hive on Windows. The endpoint tool identifies this anomalous behavior and prevents it. Abnormal API Calls: Implementation: Implement runtime analysis tools to monitor API calls and block those associated with malicious activities. Use Case: A process dynamically injects itself into another process to hijack its execution. The endpoint detects the abnormal use of APIs like OpenProcess and WriteProcessMemory and terminates the offending process. Exploit Prevention: Implementation: Use behavioral exploit prevention tools to detect and block exploits attempting to gain unauthorized access. Use Case: A buffer overflow exploit is launched against a vulnerable application. The endpoint detects the anomalous memory write operation and halts the process.

"path": "/mitigations/M1055/index.html",
"content": " Do Not Mitigate The Do Not Mitigate category highlights scenarios where attempting to mitigate a specific technique may inadvertently increase the organization's security risk or operational instability. This could happen due to the complexity of the system, the integration of critical processes, or the potential for introducing new vulnerabilities. Instead of direct mitigation, these situations may call for alternative strategies such as detection, monitoring, or response. The Do Not Mitigate category underscores the importance of assessing the trade-offs between mitigation efforts and overall system integrity. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Complex Systems Where Mitigation is Risky: Interpretation: In certain systems, direct mitigation could introduce new risks, especially if the system is highly interconnected or complex, such as in legacy industrial control systems (ICS). Patching or modifying these systems could result in unplanned downtime, disruptions, or even safety risks. Use Case: In a power grid control system, attempting to patch or disable certain services related to device communications might disrupt critical operations, leading to unintended service outages. Risk of Reducing Security Coverage: Interpretation: In some cases, mitigating a technique might reduce the visibility or effectiveness of other security controls, limiting an organization\u2019s ability to detect broader attacks. Use Case: Disabling script execution on a web server to mitigate potential PowerShell-based attacks could interfere with legitimate administrative operations that rely on scripting, while attackers may still find alternate ways to execute code. Introduction of New Vulnerabilities: Interpretation: In highly sensitive or tightly controlled environments, implementing certain mitigations might create vulnerabilities in other parts of the system. For instance, disabling default security mechanisms in an attempt to resolve compatibility issues may open the system to exploitation. Use Case: Disabling certificate validation to resolve internal communication issues in a secure environment could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, creating a greater vulnerability than the original problem. Negative Impact on Performance and Availability: Interpretation: Mitigations that involve removing or restricting system functionalities can have unintended consequences for system performance and availability. Some mitigations, while effective at blocking certain attacks, may introduce performance bottlenecks or compromise essential operations. Use Case: Implementing high levels of encryption to mitigate data theft might result in significant performance degradation in systems handling large volumes of real-time transactions.

Mitigation of this technique is also unlikely to be feasible within most contexts because there are no standard attributes from which an adversary may derive keys. If targeted, efforts should be focused on preventing adversary tools from running earlier in the chain of activity and on identifying subsequent malicious behavior if compromised. .002 Mutual Exclusion Execution Guardrails likely should not be mitigated with preventative controls because it may protect unintended targets from being compromised.

Mitigations: 13 ID Name Description M1058 Antivirus/Antimalware Mobile security products, such as Mobile Threat Defense (MTD), offer various device-based mitigations against certain behaviors. M1013 Application Developer Guidance Application Developer Guidance focuses on providing developers with the knowledge, tools, and best practices needed to write secure code, reduce vulnerabilities, and implement secure design principles. By integrating security throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC), this mitigation aims to prevent the introduction of exploitable weaknesses in applications, systems, and APIs. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: M1002 Attestation Enable remote attestation capabilities when available (such as Android SafetyNet or Samsung Knox TIMA Attestation) and prohibit devices that fail the attestation from accessing enterprise resources. M1010 Deploy Compromised Device Detection Method A variety of methods exist that can be used to enable enterprises to identify compromised (e.g. rooted/jailbroken) devices, whether using security mechanisms built directly into the device, third-party mobile security applications, enterprise mobility management (EMM)/mobile device management (MDM) capabilities, or other methods. Some methods may be trivial to evade while others may be more sophisticated. M1059 Do Not Mitigate This category is to associate techniques that mitigation might increase risk of compromise and therefore mitigation is not recommended. M1009 Encrypt Network Traffic Application developers should encrypt all of their application network traffic using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to ensure protection of sensitive data and deter network-based attacks. If desired, application developers could perform message-based encryption of data before passing it for TLS encryption. M1012 Enterprise Policy An enterprise mobility management (EMM), also known as mobile device management (MDM), system can be used to provision policies to mobile devices to control aspects of their allowed behavior. M1014 Interconnection Filtering In order to mitigate Signaling System 7 (SS7) exploitation, the Communications, Security, Reliability, and Interoperability Council (CSRIC) describes filtering interconnections between network operators to block inappropriate requests . M1003 Lock Bootloader On devices that provide the capability to unlock the bootloader (hence allowing any operating system code to be flashed onto the device), perform periodic checks to ensure that the bootloader is locked. M1001 Security Updates Install security updates in response to discovered vulnerabilities. M1004 System Partition Integrity Ensure that Android devices being used include and enable the Verified Boot capability, which cryptographically ensures the integrity of the system partition. M1006 Use Recent OS Version New mobile operating system versions bring not only patches against discovered vulnerabilities but also often bring security architecture improvements that provide resilience against potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses that have not yet been discovered. They may also bring improvements that block use of observed adversary techniques. M1011 User Guidance Describes any guidance or training given to users to set particular configuration settings or avoid specific potentially risky behaviors. "

In Zsh, fc -p can be used to create a private history session. However, previous history will be unavailable to the user until the session ends. Using unset HISTFILE and writing commands to /dev/null can also be used, similarly to Bash. In PowerShell, users can utilize Set-PSReadLineOption to modify how commands are saved into history. Setting -HistorySaveStyle SaveNothing prevents command history from being saved onto the file. Note that setting it from SaveNothing to SaveIncrementally in the same session will cause all commands from that session to be saved. Alternatively, -AddToHistoryHandler can be used to filter certain commands from being saved into the history file. References UCF. (n.d.).

"title": "Code Signing, Mitigation M1045 - Enterprise",
"path": "/mitigations/M1045/index.html",
"content": " Code Signing Code Signing is a security process that ensures the authenticity and integrity of software by digitally signing executables, scripts, and other code artifacts. It prevents untrusted or malicious code from executing by verifying the digital signatures against trusted sources. Code signing protects against tampering, impersonation, and distribution of unauthorized or malicious software, forming a critical defense against supply chain and software exploitation attacks. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Enforce Signed Code Execution: Implementation: Configure operating systems (e.g., Windows with AppLocker or Linux with Secure Boot) to allow only signed code to execute. Use Case: Prevent the execution of malicious PowerShell scripts by requiring all scripts to be signed with a trusted certificate. Vendor-Signed Driver Enforcement: Implementation: Enable kernel-mode code signing to ensure that only drivers signed by trusted vendors can be loaded. Use Case: A malicious driver attempting to modify system memory fails to load because it lacks a valid signature. Certificate Revocation Management: Implementation: Use Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) or Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) to block certificates associated with compromised or deprecated code. Use Case: A compromised certificate used to sign a malicious update is revoked, preventing further execution of the software. Third-Party Software Verification: Implementation: Require software from external vendors to be signed with valid certificates before deployment. Use Case: An organization only deploys signed and verified third-party software to prevent supply chain attacks. Script Integrity in CI/CD Pipelines: Implementation: Integrate code signing into CI/CD pipelines to sign and verify code artifacts before production release. Use Case: A software company ensures that all production builds are signed, preventing tampered builds from reaching customers. Key Components of Code Signing Digital Signature Verification: Verifies the authenticity of code by ensuring it was signed by a trusted entity. Certificate Management: Uses Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to manage signing certificates and revocation lists. Enforced Policy for Unsigned Code: Prevents the execution of unsigned or untrusted binaries and scripts. Hash Integrity Check: Confirms that code has not been altered since signing by comparing cryptographic hashes.

This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Enforce Safe Library Loading Practices: Enable SafeDLLSearchMode on Windows. Restrict LD_PRELOAD and LD_LIBRARY_PATH usage on Linux systems. Code Signing Enforcement: Require digital signatures for all libraries loaded into processes. Use tools like Signtool, and WDAC to enforce signed DLL execution. Environment Hardening: Secure library paths and directories to prevent adversaries from placing rogue libraries.

"content": " User Account Control User Account Control (UAC) is a security feature in Microsoft Windows that prevents unauthorized changes to the operating system. UAC prompts users to confirm or provide administrator credentials when an action requires elevated privileges. Proper configuration of UAC reduces the risk of privilege escalation attacks. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Enable UAC Globally: Ensure UAC is enabled through Group Policy by setting User Account Control: Run all administrators in Admin Approval Mode to Enabled. Require Credential Prompt: Use Group Policy to configure UAC to prompt for administrative credentials instead of just confirmation (User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt). Restrict Built-in Administrator Account: Set Admin Approval Mode for the built-in Administrator account to Enabled in Group Policy. Secure the UAC Prompt: Configure UAC prompts to display on the secure desktop (User Account Control: Switch to the secure desktop when prompting for elevation). Prevent UAC Bypass: Block untrusted applications from triggering UAC prompts by configuring User Account Control: Only elevate executables that are signed and validated. Use EDR tools to detect and block known UAC bypass techniques. Monitor UAC-Related Events: Use Windows Event Viewer to monitor for event ID 4688 (process creation) and look for suspicious processes attempting to invoke UAC elevation. Tools for Implementation Built-in Windows Tools: Group Policy Editor: Configure UAC settings centrally for enterprise environments.
