ATT&CK is knowledge base of adversarial techniques based on real-world observations. ATT&CK focuses on how adversaries interact with systems during an operation, reflecting the various phases of an adversary\u2019s attack lifecycle and the platforms they are known to target. Read the ATT&CK 101 Blog post for more information on the basics of ATT&CK and check the short video below. Key Concepts ATT&CK is a model that attempts to systematically categorize adversary behavior. The main components of the model are: Tactics, represents \u201cwhy\u201d or the reason an adversary is performing an action Techniques, represents \u201chow\u201d adversaries achieve tactical goals by performing an action Sub-techniques, a more specific or lower-level description of adversarial behavior Procedures, specific implementation or in-the-wild use the adversary uses for techniques or sub-techniques ATT&CK is organized in a series of technology domains, the ecosystem an adversary operates within. Currently, there are three technology domains: Enterprise, representing traditional enterprise networks and cloud technologies Mobile for mobile communication devices ICS for industrial control systems Within each domain are platforms, which may be an operating system or application (e.g. Microsoft Windows).

MITRE ATT&CK Roadmap Last updated April 2024 MITRE ATT&CK Matrix Poster Last updated April 2024 How can I use ATT&CK? The following four use cases are the most common way that users report applying ATT&CK to their work. Detections and Analytics ATT&CK can help cyber defenders develop analytics that detect the techniques used by an adversary.

For additional ATT&CK topics and to explore presentations and training: Learn More About ATT&CK How should I not use ATT&CK? ATT&CK is just as much about the mindset and process of using it as much as it is the knowledge base itself. When it comes to information security, the threats we face, new technologies, and the adaptability of goal-based adversaries, we cannot consider filling out a checklist as \u201cdone\u201d. Don\u2019t try to achieve 100% coverage. Every organization faces its own unique cyber threat. Not every tactic or technique will apply to everyone. Prioritize ones that are most relevant to you and ensure you are prepared for them. Don\u2019t shout \u201cBingo\u201d when you have one technique. Just because you have identified a single way an adversary has done a technique, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s time to declare success and color a box green. Adversaries have multiple ways they can perform most techniques. Look for and understand other ways a technique may be accomplished. Don\u2019t limit yourself to the matrix. Remember the ATT&CK matrix only documents observed real-world behaviors. Adversaries may have a series of other behaviors they use that have not been documented yet. To get a full picture of threats your organization faces, (1) Leverage your own intelligence sources, (2) create and document your own observed techniques, and (3) don\u2019t limit yourselves to behaviors, a timely indicator can catch an adversary. ATT&CK Navigator Use it to visualize defensive coverage, red/blue team planning, the frequency of detected techniques, and more.

"content": " Frequently Asked Questions Jump to Section General Content Resources Staying Informed ATT&CK and Other Models Legal General Relevant Links: ATT&CK 101 Blog PostGet Started What is ATT&CK? ATT&CK is a knowledge base of cyber adversary behavior and taxonomy for adversarial actions across their lifecycle. ATT&CK has two parts: ATT&CK for Enterprise, which covers behavior against enterprise IT networks and cloud, and ATT&CK for Mobile, which focuses on behavior against mobile devices. Why did MITRE develop ATT&CK? MITRE started ATT&CK in 2013 to document common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that advanced persistent threats use against Windows enterprise networks. It was created out of a need to document adversary behaviors for use within a MITRE research project called FMX. The objective of FMX was to investigate use of endpoint telemetry data and analytics to improve post-compromise detection of adversaries operating within enterprise networks. ATT&CK was used as the basis for testing the efficacy of the sensors and analytics under FMX and served as the common language both offense and defense could use to improve over time. What are \"tactics\"? Tactics represent the \u201cwhy\u201d of an ATT&CK technique or sub-technique. It is the adversary\u2019s tactical goal: the reason for performing an action. For example, an adversary may want to achieve credential access. What are \"techniques\"? Techniques represent \u201chow\u201d an adversary achieves a tactical goal by performing an action. For example, an adversary may dump credentials to achieve credential access. What are \"sub-techniques\"? Sub-techniques are a more specific description of the adversarial behavior used to achieve a goal. They describe behavior at a lower level than a technique. For example, an adversary may dump credentials by accessing the Local Security Authority (LSA) Secrets. What are \"procedures\"? Procedures are the specific implementation the adversary uses for techniques or sub-techniques. For example, a procedure could be an adversary using PowerShell to inject into lsass.exe to dump credentials by scraping LSASS memory on a victim. Procedures are categorized in ATT&CK as the observed in the wild use of techniques in the \"Procedure Examples\" section of technique pages. What are the differences between sub-techniques and procedures? Sub-techniques and procedures describe different things in ATT&CK. Sub-techniques are used to categorize behavior and procedures are used to describe in-the-wild use of techniques. Furthermore, since procedures are specific implementations of techniques and sub-techniques, they may include several additional behaviors in how they are performed. For example, an adversary using PowerShell to inject into lsass.exe to dump credentials by scraping LSASS memory on a victim is a procedure implementation containing several (sub)techniques covering the PowerShell, Process Injection, and Credential Dumping against LSASS behaviors. What technologies does ATT&CK apply to? Enterprise IT systems covering Windows, macOS, Linux, Network infrastructure devices (Network), and Container technologies (Containers); cloud systems covering Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Office Suite, and Identity Provider; mobile devices covering Android and iOS. How can I use ATT&CK? ATT&CK can be used in several ways to help security operations, threat intelligence, and security architecture. See the Get Started page for resources on how to start using ATT&CK. Also check out the Resources section of the website and the blog for related projects and other material. Content Relevant Links: ContributeThe Design and Philosophy of ATT&CK How often is ATT&CK updated? Bi-annually. Where does the info in ATT&CK come from? Publicly available threat intelligence and incident reporting is the main source of data in ATT&CK. We take what's available in the public and distill out common TTPs. We also use publicly available research on new techniques that closely align with what adversaries commonly do since new TTPs often get used in the wild quickly. For more information see The Design and Philosophy of ATT&CK. How can I contribute content to ATT&CK? Check out our contribute page! Please contact us before spending a lot of time writing up a new technique/group/software since we always have things in the works and don\u2019t want you to duplicate efforts. For any contributions we add, we'll run the final product by you and credit you as a contributor. In particular, we're looking for Mac/Linux contributions. My \"favorite\" threat group isn't included in ATT&CK - why? We try to include most threat reporting but can only get to so much. If you feel information is missing, then help us by contributing to ATT&CK. Reach out to see if we\u2019re already working on the group and review our contribute page for guidance and formatting for group and software submissions. Resources Relevant Links: ATT&CK Data & ToolsStaying Informed Are there APIs I can use to access the ATT&CK content? Yes! Check out this page: ATT&CK Data & Tools. Staying Informed How do I stay up to date with what's happening with ATT&CK? Follow @MITREattack on Twitter for news and check out our blog for posts about topics related to ATT&CK. ATT&CK and Other Models How does ATT&CK relate to other cyber frameworks and models? Each model and framework can be used for different purposes. We have documented several use cases where ATT&CK can be used to provide granular detail on adversary behavior. We believe most models and frameworks are complementary to ATT&CK, so you don't have to choose just one. What is the relationship between ATT&CK and the Diamond Model? ATT&CK and the Diamond Model are complementary. ATT&CK documents detailed adversary behavior while the Diamond Model is helpful if you're trying to cluster intrusions. There are cases where they may be used together. For example, ATT&CK-mapped techniques may be a useful source of input into the Diamond Model to analyze adversary capabilities. What is the relationship between ATT&CK and the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain\u00ae? ATT&CK and the Cyber Kill Chain are complementary. ATT&CK sits at a lower level of definition to describe adversary behavior than the Cyber Kill Chain. ATT&CK Tactics are unordered and may not all occur in a single intrusion because adversary tactical goals change throughout an operation, whereas the Cyber Kill Chain uses ordered phases to describe high level adversary objectives. Legal Relevant Links: Legal & BrandingContact Us How should I reference the name ATT&CK? Both MITRE ATT&CK\u00ae and ATT&CK\u00ae are registered trademarks of The MITRE Corporation. Your first references in writing must include \"MITRE\" preceding \"ATT&CK\u00ae\" - but subsequently should just reference \"ATT&CK\" (no registered trademark symbol required). Example of a first reference: MITRE ATT&CK\u00ae is a curated knowledge base and model for cyber adversary behavior... Example of subsequent reference: ATT&CK is useful for understanding security risk against known adversary behavior... A headline should always reference \"MITRE ATT&CK\" together (never only \"ATT&CK\u00ae\"). Always capitalize \"ATT&CK\" to distinguish it from the surrounding text. Do not modify the trademark, such as through hyphenation or abbreviation. For example, \"ATT&CK'd!\", \"Plan-of-ATT&CK\", \"ATTK\". You may not display the ATT&CK trademark in any manner that implies an affiliation with, sponsorship, or endorsement by MITRE, or in a manner that can be reasonably interpreted to suggest third party content represents the views and opinions of MITRE or MITRE personnel, unless those third parties receive express permission from MITRE. You may not use ATT&CK in your product names, service names, trademarks, logos, or company names. For more information please visit our Legal & Branding Where can I download the MITRE ATT&CK logo?

We encourage you to keep watching and sharing these insightful sessions! Presentations Keynote: Cyber for Good Lillian Teng, Cybersecurity Leader Recording Slide Deck MITRE ATT&CK Updates: State of the ATT&CK Adam Pennington, MITRE ATT&CK ATT&CK Lead Adam Pennington discusses the latest changes in MITRE ATT&CK and what's coming down the pike for the framework. Recording Slide Deck The Never-evolving Threat Landscape: Forever Techniques and the Illusion of Change Brian Donohue, Red Canary \"The ever-evolving threat landscape\" is one of the most overused clich\u00e9s in the security industry. It\u2019s so ubiquitous that LLMs lead nearly every prompt response with some iteration of those five words. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately), it doesn\u2019t reflect reality. The threat landscape isn\u2019t ever-evolving. If you track MITRE ATT&CK\u00ae technique abuse over time, you\u2019ll find that adversaries largely leverage the same small set of techniques\u2014and have for years. Threat names change, but the objectives of those threats and the capabilities they deploy are stagnant. There\u2019s a strong illusion of change in adversary behavior propped up by new technologies, the vagaries of visibility, and our collective obsession with sophistication and novelty. You\u2019ll read new articles about staggering breaches, but the technical details often reveal a pattern of well-worn tactics, techniques, and procedures. You\u2019ll read news articles about fantastical targeted attacks, but if you read below the fold or between the lines, you\u2019ll realize the adversary was after a specific organization for a specific reason. In this talk, I will use operational data and historical examples to argue that the past is indeed a good predictor of the future, and enumerate the ATT&CK techniques that organizations should prioritize. Recording Slide Deck Practical Application of MITRE ATT&CK: Tactical CTI to Enable Security Operations Andy Castro, Feedly CTI reporting can often lack the technical information for the teams who need to act on it. This talk shows how to make threat intel more tactical and useful by aligning it to the workflows of detection engineers, threat hunters, and incident responders using MITRE ATT&CK as a shared framework. I\u2019ll walk through how to tailor reporting to different security functions, highlight key elements each team actually cares about, and show how to go from report to a hunt-ready package. I\u2019ll also share code that extracts ATT&CK techniques from a report and pulls mapped Sigma rules to support hunting and detection. Attendees will leave with practical strategies to turn reporting into results, speak the language of their security teams, and use ATT&CK to operationalize threat intelligence across functions. Recording Slide Deck What the Adversary Taught Me: Using ATT&CK to Identify TTP Trends and Prioritize Detections Krysta Horocofsky and Connor Kovacs, Recorded Future Security teams continually strive to stay ahead of adversaries by accurately identifying, tracking, and prioritizing threat behaviors. The MITRE ATT&CK Framework is an invaluable tool for categorizing adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). This presentation explores how systematic mapping of adversarial behaviors using the ATT&CK framework can reveal trends, helping organizations refine their detection and response strategies. Leveraging Recorded Future\u2019s extensive threat intelligence and Insikt Group\u2019s dedicated research into new and emerging threats, we illustrate workflows for extracting meaningful TTPs from open-source intelligence. We discuss methodologies, including manual and AI-assisted techniques, emphasizing accuracy and clarity in differentiating between human-driven adversary actions and automated malware behavior. We present practical methods for visualizing TTP trends and attack chains, highlighting effective prioritization strategies based on prevalence, impact, and visibility. Through detailed case studies, we demonstrate how to correlate ATT&CK data with real-world malware campaigns and develop targeted detection rules using Sigma and other frameworks. Recording Slide Deck MITRE ATT&CK Updates: Defensive ATT&CK Lex Crumpton, MITRE ATT&CK Recording Slide Deck Hunt Smarter, Not Harder: The Piranha Approach to Threat-Informed Defense William Smail and Jared Thornton, Analyst What good is threat intelligence to operations if they speak a different language? Bridging the gap between cyber threat intelligence and defensive operations requires more than shared intent\u2014it requires shared structure. Without a common framework, intelligence stays abstract and operations stay reactive. This workflow-driven approach uses the MITRE ATT&CK framework as a foundation to translate CTI into relevant hunt plans by combining adversary TTP mapping, CVE to TTP correlation, and optimized tactic selection\u2014each reinforcing the others to align with a team\u2019s collection capabilities to ensure. Through the symphony and harmony of this data, we can create actionable hunt plans that not only align with intelligence, but remain relevant to what your network is vulnerable to.These methods have been applied across threat emulation and hunt operations and reinforced through the development of Piranha, an open-source tool built to support\u2014but not define\u2014the process. For teams working to bridge the divide between intel and operations, this approach offers a practical path toward unified, threat-informed defense. Recording Slide Deck Unlocking ATT&CK: Why Procedures Matter More Than Techniques Billy Purnell, Lloyds Banking Group While MITRE ATT&CK has become a cornerstone of threat-informed defense, most implementations stop at the technique level\u2014offering broad categorizations that lack the procedural depth needed for real-world application. This talk explores the critical limitations of technique-level mappings and makes the case for elevating procedures as the foundation for actionable security outcomes. We\u2019ll examine how vague or inconsistent procedure descriptions hinder detection engineering, purple teaming, and control validation. Then, we\u2019ll introduce a structured approach to solving this problem\u2014 defining a common schema for procedures, building a graph-based procedural intelligence repository, and operationalising it through analyst tooling and automation. Finally, we\u2019ll show how a procedure base enables threat-informed detection, automates purple teaming, and supports meaningful control effectiveness assessments\u2013 all grounded in what attackers actually do, not just what they\u2019re mapped to. If you\u2019re looking to move beyond checkbox ATT&CK coverage and toward meaningful, threat-driven security, this session is for you. Recording Slide Deck Human-First Tactics Red Teaming Where Automation Fails to Simulate Techniques Berk Kandemir, IBM In an era dominated by automation, AI tooling and simulated adversaries, one truth is still with us: the most impactful Red Team operations still hinge on human creativity. I will try to explore the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of Reconnaissance, Resource Development, and Initial Access areas where automation falters and the human mind thrives. Most of the security vendors promise full-spectrum simulation for MITRE, but these are mostly script based small automation techniques which are not reflecting real attack chains. The techniques such as building trust relationships, phishing for critical context, discovering companies' unknowns, the historical records of entities, or discovering obscure services and their underlying logic remain deeply human tasks. I will walk through real Red Team success stories where manual investigation, social navigation, and out-of-the-box thinking exposed critical gaps that tools could never detect. Attendees will see the human-driven operations, practical examples of manual techniques that worked, and a clear understanding of why early-stage tactics in ATT&CK still demand intuition, analysis, human interactions with sense, and social engineering, \u2014not scripts. Recording Slide Deck Beyond Detection Engineering: Building Signals Engineering at GitLab Matthew Coons, Gitlab Detection Engineering has become a cybersecurity buzzword, but many organizations have overwhelming alerts and rely on vendor provided detection capabilities. At GitLab, we've evolved beyond traditional Detection Engineering to create Signals Engineering \u2013 fundamentally digging deeper into the signals that group together into security detections. This presentation reveals how we built GitLab's Signals Engineering Team (SET) with a single vision - to ensure cybersecurity incidents never go undetected. We will cover key innovations such as AI powered detection reviews, User Attestation Module (UAM), which routes 40% of security alerts to end-users for self-validation through Slack automation, and our GitLab CI/CD pipeline that automatically validates, tests, and deploys SIEM detections with comprehensive quality checks and cover how we've leveraged MITRE ATT&CK and maturity models like Summiting the Pyramid as a north star for detection and signals engineering. The audience will learn practical implementation strategies for Detection-as-Code, metrics-driven detection improvement, and building self-service security capabilities that scale. We will cover what went well and what we learned from. Attendees will leave with a number of actionable insights and useful knowledge applicable to any organization with a desire to effectively and proactively detect potential threats. Recording Slide Deck Paste and rundown: Tracking and clustering ClickFix campaigns Stef Rand, Red Canary Paste and run (aka ClickFix, fakeCAPTCHA) has been one of the most successful initial execution vectors in the past year, and it\u2019s only getting more popular. From its first reported use in March 2024 to the March 2025 addition of T1204.004 User Execution: Malicious Copy and Paste to MITRE ATT&CK, Red Canary has seen our fair share of users tricked into copying, pasting, and executing malicious code via T1204.004. I\u2019ll dig into some of the threat intelligence challenges we faced tracking and clustering this threat from an endpoint perspective, and share how leveraging its ATT&CK technique helped us. Attendees will learn about the Red Canary threat intel team's research into this threat over the past year and walk away with practicable detection opportunities. Recording Slide Deck Automating ATT&CK Flow Diagrams for Faster Threat Analysis David Johnson, Feedly CTI analysts spend hours reading technical reports to understand attack flows. This manual process creates bottlenecks in the threat response process. I built FlowViz to automatically generate ATT&CK flow diagrams from threat intelligence reports. The program uses large language models to parse STIX objects, extract attack procedures, and create interactive visualizations. Analysts click on nodes to see detailed context. The tool can also process images in technical documents and export results as PNG, JSON, or ATT&CK Flow Builder files. This presentation demonstrates how automating with FlowViz can help analysts gather insights faster. I will demonstrate real-world examples of complex attack chains that can be mapped in seconds, rather than hours. FlowViz will be open-sourced and offered as a service. I will discuss API integration for automated threat intelligence pipelines. Attendees will learn how AI augments ATT&CK framework usage without replacing human judgment. Recording Slide Deck The Self-Healing Detection System: A Practical Framework for Strengthening Your Threat Coverage Rajesh Sharma and Jacob Schorr, AttackIQ Inc and Accenture As detection rule libraries expand, security teams face a paradox: more alerts, more tools\u2014but limited improvement in actual threat prevention. In this talk, we present a new perspective: treating your detection stack as a living system, one that can become bloated, misfiring, or even self-destructive without care. We introduce a four-dimensional scoring framework\u2014Resilience, Impact, Readiness, and Relevance\u2014to help practitioners assess and strengthen their detection logic. This model helps identify broken rules, prioritize high-value detections, and reduce alert noise by focusing on measurable defensive value. We then explore how this framework lays the foundation for an exciting future: a self-healing detection system, capable of continuously improving itself. In this vision, agentic AI acts like an immune system trainer\u2014testing defenses, pruning dead logic, and reinforcing the rules that matter most. Whether you're tuning detections by hand or imagining the next frontier in adaptive defense, this talk delivers both a practical methodology and a compelling outlook on what comes next. Recording Slide Deck Updates from the Center for Threat-Informed Defense Suneel Sundar and Leslie Anderson, MITRE ATT&CK Recording Slide Deck Executive Welcome - ATT&CKcon 6.0 Day 2 Mark Peters, MITRE Day 2 welcome address from Mark Peters, the CEO of MITRE. Recording ATT&CK v17 and the Increasingly Targeted ESXi Attack Surface Joseph Comps, Vali Cyber As enterprise virtualization scales, hypervisors like VMware ESXi have emerged as critical\u2014and increasingly exploited\u2014attack surfaces. High-profile breaches such as the Scattered Spider attacks, MGM Resorts ($110M) breach, and Johnson Controls ($51M) breach, highlight the hypervisor\u2019s massive blast radius and the lasting operational disruption that can result when this layer is compromised. This session presents a deep dive into real-world techniques leveraged by ransomware groups to breach ESXi environments, including remote execution via the Service Location Protocol (SLP), identity-based escalation through misconfigured Active Directory integrations, and traditional credential cracking targeting hypervisor management interfaces. With the release of ATT&CK v17, these attack paths are now formally recognized by the addition of the ESXi platform\u2014providing long-needed structure and validation for what defenders have seen in the wild. We\u2019ll walk through how each phase of these attacks maps to specific ATT&CK techniques, and show how this knowledge can inform detection, threat hunting, and hardening strategies. Attendees will leave with a practical understanding of hypervisor-layer tradecraft and a framework for closing coverage gaps using ATT&CK. This talk is ideal for red teamers, blue teamers, and infrastructure defenders looking to secure one of the most overlooked\u2014and increasingly targeted\u2014layers in enterprise infrastructure. Recording Slide Deck ATT&CKing VMWare From a Defender's Perspective Reid Gilman, Boston Children's Hospital Extortion threat actors have figured out that lots of organizations use VMWare and it tends to be mission-critical infrastructure. In this talk, we will discuss how we assessed threats to a VMWare environment, how we designed defensive measures, and how those map to ATT&CK. We will discuss challenges that defenders face both justifying and implementing defenses like this. We will also talk about challenges defenders face using a tool like ATT&CK in a scenario with limited threat intelligence. This talk will be less focused on threat intelligence and more focused on a defender's perspective using ATT&CK in the context of designing defenses for a complex environment. While this talk will use VMWare as an example, we believe the concepts apply to other hypervisors and other critical enterprise systems. Recording Slide Deck Leveraging ATT&CK to Fortify Detections for Scattered Spider and Other Advanced Threats Damien Miller-McAndrews, Obsidian Security Join Damien, Threat Researcher at Obsidian Security, and dive into the web of the notorious hacker group Scattered Spider. We\u2019ll analyze Scattered Spider from a SaaS perspective, looking at their TTPs and covering notable incidents both public and undisclosed. Then, you'll learn how Obsidian has used ATT&CK to improve detection coverage for Scattered Spider and other advanced actors, and how you can too. Recording Slide Deck MITRE ATT&CK Updates: Enterprise Lauren Lusty, MITRE ATT&CK Recording Slide Deck Living off the Cloud: Classifying \"LOAB & LOAR\" Techniques and Detecting them with the MITRE ATT&CK Cloud Matrix Hieu Tran, FPT Software Endpoint \"living-off-the-land\" binaries are old news; attackers are now abusing built-in cloud tools instead. We introduce LOAB (Living Off Azure Binaries) and LOAR (Living Off AWS Resources): a curated set of cloud-native primitives\u2014think azcopy, ssm start-session, sts assume-role, and more\u2014that enable malware-free execution, lateral movement, and exfiltration. By analyzing recent ransomware and espionage breaches and mapping each primitive to the MITRE ATT&CK Cloud matrix, we created an open-source Navigator layer, a detection pack (Sigma, KQL, CloudWatch), and atomic test scripts.During the session, a live purple-team demo shows AzCopy data theft and SSM pivoting in a sandbox, the rules firing, and an ATT&CK heat-map changing from red to green. Attendees leave with drop-in queries, ready-made tests, and a CI template that fails any pull request when coverage gaps reappear. Recording Extending ATT&CK: Modeling Sector-Specific Threats with Workbench and Navigator Jared Quinn, FBI What happens when adversaries exploit the implicit trust placed in sector-specific file formats - like medical imaging files - instead of traditional malware? This presentation explores a healthcare-specific threat scenario involving DICOM (.dcm) files and introduces a custom MITRE ATT&CK extension that captures how these files can be weaponized. Using Workbench and Navigator, the talk walks through the creation of a new Sub-Technique - Malicious Domain-Specific File (Healthcare) - under T1204: User Execution, and demonstrates how custom Mitigations, Detections, and Analytics were developed to support it. Attendees will see how injector and scanner scripts were built to simulate abuse (e.g., spoofed transfer syntax UIDs, private metadata tags, and embedded payloads) and how these behaviors were mapped in a reusable ATT&CK Navigator Layer. This isn\u2019t just a healthcare problem - it\u2019s a reminder of how ATT&CK can capture threats unique to critical sectors. Attendees will leave with a concrete example of how to build sector-informed content using ATT&CK tooling and apply it to their own operational environments. Recording Slide Deck MITRE ATT&CK Updates: New Tactics in Enterprise Cat Self, MITRE ATT&CK Recording Slide Deck Inside the Browser Matrix: Mapping the Unseen Threat Surface Neal Humphrey, Seraphic Security The browser is no longer just a delivery mechanism; it's an active execution surface. Yet, ATT&CK lacks a dedicated platform to represent browser-native techniques, such as extension abuse, cross-context messaging hijack, session token exfiltration, and DOM-based persistence. In this session, we walk through the process of discovering, simulating, and mapping these browser-specific TTPs using BrowserTotal, an open threat emulation and telemetry platform designed to expose browser-layer threats. We\u2019ll share real-world observations, ATT&CK mappings, and gaps, and propose an expansion of the ATT&CK Matrix to formally introduce \u201cBrowser\u201d as a platform. The session concludes with a bold proposal: launching a new MITRE Evaluation Track for Browser Security, which will cover simulation design, evaluation criteria, and open telemetry contributions. Key takeaways for attendees: A new lens to view browsers as threat surfaces, Real ATT&CK-aligned browser TTPs observed and simulated, Blueprint for contributing techniques to the ATT&CK matrix, Call to action to join a proposed MITRE Evaluation for browser platforms Recording Slide Deck Discovering Co-occurrence Patterns of MITRE ATT&CK Techniques in CTI Reports Saurav Bhattacharya, The New World Foundation This study analyzes MITRE ATT&CK technique usage and co-occurrence patterns across sentence-level and report-level annotations in the CTI-HAL dataset. We explore both the limits and insights of rule-based association mining at the sentence level and demonstrate stronger co-occurrence signals when techniques are grouped at the document level. Frequency distributions, negative results, and the implications for threat detection, adversary emulation, and ATT&CK coverage prioritization are discussed. We also evaluate the role of annotation sparsity, technique coverage bias, and the implications of low co-occurrence on adversary modeling. Recording Slide Deck REALITYCHECK: An ATT&CK-Aligned, Principled, and Automated Investigation of AR/VR Attacks Muhammad Shoaib and Wajih Ul Hassan, University of Virginia Augmented- and virtual-reality head-mounted displays (HMDs) are quickly moving from gaming novelties to mission-critical platforms in medicine, training, and industrial control. Yet today\u2019s security monitoring tools cannot trace attacks that cross the headset/PC boundary or exploit the unique sensory pipeline of immersive systems. We introduce REALITYCHECK, the first provenance-based auditing framework that maps the entire AR/VR kill-chain to MITRE ATT&CK tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and then reconstructs each step in a single multilayer provenance graph. Starting from an eight-attribute threat model derived from 25 real-world exploits, we extend the W3C PROV ontology with new entities such as SpatialBoundary and HeadsetCollisionTracker and automatically correlate logs from OpenXR, Android, and Windows endpoints. A novel session-state execution-partitioning algorithm eliminates 70% of false dependencies, while graph-pruning retains only the vertices and edges that form Direct or Indirect Forensic Connections to ATT&CK-labelled detection points. Evaluated on Meta Quest 2 (90% of the HMD market) against 25 attacks, including new ATT&CK-aligned techniques for Perceptual Manipulation, 6DoF Data Exfiltration, and Endpoint-Driven Lateral Movement, REALITYCHECK achieved perfect root-cause coverage with <6 % runtime overhead. Attendees will leave with an open-source tool and a reproducible methodology for building ATT&CK-driven detections in emerging XR environments. Recording Slide Deck D3FEND Before You ATT&CK Tareq AlKhatib, Fortinet At ATT&CKcon 5.0, we made the case that ATT&CK objects can be represented in graph format by defining a common cyber-ontology. Since then, we have been working with the D3FEND team to define ATT&CK objects using the D3FEND ontology. This talk shares our progress on this front, including how we redefine Data Sources, Techniques, and Procedures. We also show how the audience can use this work to redefine how they do detection engineering and incident response using ontology/graph-based principles.

Recording Slide Deck Birds of a Feather: The Evolution of Threat Actor Prioritization, Gap Analysis, and Detection Curation using ATT&CK Brett Tolbert and Abdul Williams, North America Media Company The MITRE ATT&CK Framework has significantly evolved over the last ten years and its impact on cybersecurity teams is paramount. Likewise, the cyber threat intelligence (CTI) and detection engineering (DE) domains have matured in its principles and outcomes. ATT&CK influences CTI and DE practices by allowing varied cybersecurity teams to communicate tradecraft in a singular language, track and prioritize security threat coverage, and assess threat actor capabilities. However, integrating and maximizing modern ATT&CK use cases in preexisting CTI and DE programs without many resources can be a challenging overhaul. In this presentation, we will discuss the arc of CTI's and DE's evolution due to the prevalence of ATT&CK. We will explore how it can be integrated in cybersecurity programs by providing specific use cases on gap analysis, threat actor prioritization, and blue team tools like VirusTotal and AttackIQ. Finally, we will provide recommendations on building and automating CTI and DE practices that incorporate ATT&CK regardless of resource strain. After attending this talk, attendees will understand how to identify, prioritize, and implement new opportunities to incorporate ATT&CK in CTI and DE programs, impacting the effectiveness of these practices for their respective organizations. Recording Slide Deck Practical Application of MITRE ATT&CK: Real World Usage in a Corporate Environment Marcelle Lee, Equinix Marcelle Lee, principal information security engineer, Equinix, deep dives on the practical application of MITRE ATT&CK in a corporate environment -- from research to break down TTPs to better understand threats to security controls gap analysis to better identify where gaps may exist based on identified TTPs. Recording Slide Deck ATT&CK Updates: Defenses Lex Crumpton, MITRE ATT&CK ATT&CK Defensive Lead Lex Crumpton discussed the latest mitigations added for defenders, the work by the Center for Threat-Informed Defense on sensor mappings to ATT&CK, and new SPL analytics to make it easier for defenders to optimize their detection engineering processes. Recording Slide Deck What sets us apart? Industries vs. infrastructure as differentiator for technique abuse and threat prevalence Alexandrea Berninger and Brian Donohue, Red Canary A core tenet of threat intelligence is the idea that different threats affect different organizations. However, an organization\u2019s industry alone is rarely a key factor in predicting the threats they are likely to face. We know this because we used the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) to categorize more than 1,000 organizations into sectors and analyzed the disparity in ATT&CK technique abuse and threat prevalence between them. In this talk, we will leverage hundreds of petabytes of data from realized threats to describe the nuanced differences in detection data that do exist between organizations in different industries. We will also explain why those differences likely exist, and we will explore explore the factors within organizations that are better predictors of threat exposure than industry or sector alone. By attending this talk, you will gain a better understanding of: - ATT&CK technique and threat trends across the 20 primary NAICS sectors - factors within organizations that play an important role in differentiating the threats they face - how to think about an organization\u2019s industry or sector during the threat modeling process - the predominance of advantageous adversaries in the threat landscape Recording Slide Deck This is Why We Don't Shout \"Bingo\": Analyzing ATT&CK Integration in Endpoint Detection Rulesets Apurva Virkud, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign In spite of early and frequent warnings not to shout \u201cBingo,\u201d ATT&CK technique coverage continues to be touted by security products and is used by organizations and purchasers as the basis for evaluating security posture. In coverage-based assessments, having at least one detection rule for as many techniques as possible is prioritized over the depth or quality of detections. But why is this such a bad idea? To understand the implications of coverage-based assessments, we examine the ATT&CK technique annotations in four major endpoint detection rulesets: Carbon Black, Splunk, Elastic, and Sigma. We find that large regions of the Enterprise ATT&CK Matrix are unimplemented in all rulesets (53 Techniques), in part due to the fact that many techniques are unrealizable as endpoint detection rules. We go on to consider how consistently different rulesets apply technique annotations \u2013 even when attempting to detect the same malicious entity, products completely disagree about the appropriate ATT&CK technique annotations 51% of the time, while fully agreeing just 2.7% of the time. Put another way, \u201ccovering\u201d one technique may not even suggest protection from the same threat across different products. These findings underscore the dangers of coverage-based ATT&CK assessments. Recording Slide Deck Confessions of an Ex-FBI Profiler: 3 Things I Wish I Knew About MITRE ATT&CK Tim Pappa, Walmart Global Tech This presentation is a confession of a former FBI profiler who never used MITRE ATT&CK when applying cyber behavioral analysis to design approaches to behaviorally exploit attackers. This cyber deception practitioner\u2019s presentation will share three lessons learned about designing behaviorally based cyber deception and influence campaigns against attackers and attack groups, demonstrating how MITRE ATT&CK could have guided the design of deception and influence campaigns to make them more plausible and more effective at driving attacker behaviors online. This presentation will reference ATT&CK\u2019s historical archive on Volatile Cedar as an example. These confessional lessons learned suggests that MITRE ATT&CK can provide an instrumental design step in conceptualizing and materializing behaviorally based cyber deception and influence campaigns. Recording Slide Deck ATT&CK Updates: CTI Joe Slowik, MITRE ATT&CK ATT&CK CTI Lead Joe Slowik, discusses the latest ATT&CK improvements to hit its cyber threat intelligence goals: capture the relevant threat landscape in a timely fashion, enhance coverage on additional geographics and e-crime actors, and leverage campaign objects for more accurate representation of how activity changes over time. Recording Slide Deck From ATT&CK to CL&IM: Cyber Insurance Data Modeling using MITRE ATT&CK and beyond Matt Berninger, Marsh McLennan Before ATT&CK, defenders and intelligence analysts couldn't meaningfully compare notes, since different terms were used for different things, and there was no central repository of definitions to rely on. By providing a common taxonomy of TTPs, MITRE ATT&CK has allowed for the type of coordination, comparison, and collaboration that over the last decade has made defenders meaningfully better at tracking and stopping adversaries. In the world of cyber insurance, we face a similar problem. We lack common definitions and frameworks. When insurers wish to share data analysis or trends, the signals get confused. What is the difference between a ransomware claim, a phishing claim, and a malware claim? When does BEC involve a compromise versus simple impersonation fraud? These definitions matter when we use this data to inform risk profiles, control investments, insurance pricing, and business decisions. Property insurance doesn't confuse hurricanes and tornadoes, and neither should cyber insurance. In this talk we will outline the framework we've developed at Marsh McLennan to tackle this issue, and how we connect to and integrate MITRE ATT&CK. We hope to illuminate some issues, and provide a path forward to clarify the confusion. Recording Slide Deck A Guide to Evaluating Threat Detection Coverage Eli Schorr, Accenture Using ATT&CK and MITRE CTID\u2019s StP Frameworks to Assess Threat Detection Resilience - A Guide to Evaluating Threat Detection Coverage. In today's evolving cybersecurity landscape, enhancing threat detection capabilities is crucial. This presentation introduces the practical application of MITRE CTID\u2019s new Summitting the Pyramid (StP) framework to evaluate and improve threat detection resilience using the ATT&CK framework. The StP framework offers a robust methodology to enhance threat detection analytics by evaluating them against the adversary\u2019s cost to evade. It addresses the common issue where many analytics depend heavily on specific tools or artifacts, making them susceptible to low-cost evasion techniques by adversaries. Our journey with StP will uncover its evolution and key concepts such as core ATT&CK techniques, core procedures, preexisting and TA-brought tools, and ephemeral IOCs. We will engage the audience in a poll on real-world threat detection rule bypass strategies. Applying the StP framework to ATT&CK, we'll demonstrate how to evaluate and improve threat detection rule resilience through case studies from real-world assessments. The session will illustrate how integrating the ATT&CK and StP frameworks creates a comprehensive threat risk map, enhancing the qualitative depth of ATT&CK coverage. Attendees will leave with practical knowledge on applying the StP framework, understanding its value, and integrating it with the ATT&CK framework for a robust threat detection strategy. Recording Slide Deck Bridging the Gap: Enhancing Detection Coverage with Atomic Red Team, Sigma, and MITRE ATT&CK Hare Sudhan Muthusamy, Walmart Global Tech Detection Coverage is a metric that evaluates how effectively an organization's detection capabilities align with threat actors' techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs). Manually assessing detection coverage against the MITRE ATT&CK matrix is time-consuming for organizations, especially considering the many security measures in use, such as SIEM, EDR, and more. Even if organizations attempt complex automation to generate detection coverage from all security products, the detections are not guaranteed to be accurate and up-to-date. This session addresses the issues mentioned above and presents how to perform continuous execution and validation with a minimal infrastructure via GitHub Actions and Docker containers to create a replicated lab environment where we execute atomic tests using Atomic Red Team, generate and send logs to a centralized logging infrastructure, and continuously validate them against Sigma detections. It also demonstrates the immense value of mapping attacks and detections against the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix and visualizes the results using the ATT&CK Navigator. These visualizations offer valuable insights into the organization's security posture, highlighting any missing detections. Furthermore, this talk will provide insights into the hurdles of utilizing Github Actions and Docker containers for threat hunting. Recording Slide Deck Closing Remarks - Day 1 Amy Robertson and Joe Slowick, MITRE MITRE's Amy Roberston and Joe Slowik close out Day 1 of ATT&CKcon 5.0 and how best to use ATT&CK to better understand the adversary. Recording Featured Speaker: Mark Singer Mark Singer, CISA Threat Hunting Mark Singer, CISA Threat Branch Chief, discusses how cyber is a team sport and dives into a few successful cases studies such as defending Ukraine from Russia. Recording Lifecycle-Aware Power Side-Channel Malware Detection Alexander Cathis, The University of Texas at Austin Malware detectors analyzing the power side-channel have been demonstrated as an effective out-of-band defense for high-assurance embedded systems. Prior work has mainly targeted simple single-core systems focusing on the noisy exploit stages of an attack lifecycle. Such approaches do not scale to modern embedded multi-core platforms running parallel workloads. Detection performance is further exacerbated against inherently stealthy or deliberately evasive attack lifecycles. In this talk, we propose a novel lifecycle-aware power-based malware detector to defend complex multi-core embedded systems against evasive and non-evasive attack lifecycles. We briefly describe an ensemble of state-specific one-class detectors that are trained on different benign operating states and then combined to scale to complex benign scenarios. Next, we introduce the key realization that real-world attacks require a lifecycle of multiple stages to prime the attack, execute it, and perform post-exploit actions. By augmenting the ensemble detector with a lifecycle-aware hidden Markov model that captures general attack lifecycles, we greatly improve detection performance. We test our detector against attack lifecycles formed according to the MITRE ATT&CK matrix using various microarchitecture, software, and network actions and show our lifecycle-aware detector\u2019s strong performance against attack lifecycles that have evaded traditional detectors. Recording Slide Deck Next-Gen Threat-Informed Defense: Human-Assisted Intelligent Agents Shravan Ravi and Rajesh Sharma, AttackIQ AttackIQ's Rajesh Sharma and Shravan Ravi discuss how human-assisted intelligence agents can help in threat-informed defense. Recording Slide Deck ATT&CK Updates: Enterprise Casey Knerr, MITRE ATT&CK Casey Knerr, ATT&CK Enterpise Lead, discusses the changes to ATT&CK based on indentity-as-a-service platforms. Recording Slide Deck ATT&CK From Basic Principles Tareq ALKhatib, Lacework (A Fortinet Company) We propose a framework where a set of entities (nodes) and the interactions between them (edges) is defined to form an Ontology. Once defined, we attempt to derive many of the concepts defined in ATT&CK, including Data Sources as edges between nodes; Techniques as one or more interactions between entities with some properties specified for the interactions or the entities; and Detections being similar to techniques with possibly different properties. We will also briefly give examples of how this system can be used to judge the strength of a detection rule in a manner similar to MITRE Engenuity\u2019s \u201cSubmitting The Pyramid\u201d. We will finally end the presentation with examples of how this framework can be used for Threat Modeling, especially with broader Techniques. At the conference, we intend to release a mapping of as many Techniques as we can to this Ontology framework as well as a list of \u201cEnvironment-dependent Entities\u201d for use in Threat Modeling. Recording Slide Deck Sources of ATT&CK: A Bibliographic Journey through Enterprise ATT&CK Robert Funches, CACI International Pop quiz: do you know what\u2019s at the bottom of the page for every ATT&CK technique, group, software, and mitigation? (No cheating!) It\u2019s a list of references: the cyber threat intelligence that underpins ATT&CK and provides valuable information about adversary tactics and techniques. Peel back that layer, though, and you\u2019ll discover the history of ATT&CK and the broader cybersecurity landscape. In this talk, learn how to work programmatically with the data in ATT&CK, explore the references in ATT&CK through visualizations and analysis, and give back to the ATT&CK community through recommendations and calls-for-action. Recording Slide Deck ATT&CK Updates: Software Jared Ondricek, MITRE ATT&CK Jared Ondricek is a Principal DevOps Engineer in the Software Engineering Innovation Center at MITRE. He manages the ATT&CK website, Navigator, Workbench, mitreattack-python package, public facing TAXII server, and other infrastructure in support of the MITRE ATT&CK team. The TAXI 2.0 server is retiring on Dec. 18, 2024, and users should move to TAXI 2.1. Jared also goes over the latest ATT&CK Navigator updates. Recording Slide Deck SaaSy ATT&CK \u2013 Practical ATT&CK usage for SaaS-based Telemetry Aaron Shelmire, Abstract Security The ATT&CK Matrices have proven invaluable for Endpoint, Network, IoT and Cloud detection and threat research. As organizations adopt more SaaS software, and organizations gain visibility into their SaaS-estates, how can we apply ATT&CK to SaaS? In this talk we\u2019ll share how the Abstract Security team has used ATT&CK to help drive threat research into SaaS attacks, and used ATT&CK to assist detection engineering of SaaS telemetry. Recording Slide Deck Every Cloud Has a Purple Lining Arun Seelagan, CISA This talk presents how ATT&CK was used to fill gaps in cloud technique coverage during a recent purple team exercise. By emulating threat actor tactics in a simulated hybrid cloud environment, a joint team of incident responders and data scientists was able to discern strengths and deficiencies in cloud data sources and formulate detection logic for malicious behaviors. These outcomes were achieved by systematically mapping red team activities to ATT&CK and tracking blue team coverage using a purple team campaign management capability. As a result, cloud visibility gaps are being closed and ATT&CK-annotated detection rules operationalized to accelerate threat detection on critical networks. Recording Slide Deck The Missing Tactic Techniques of ATT&CK \"Collection\" Rich Johnson, Thales TCT/Imperva Databases are ubiquitous, so much so there appears to be insufficient emphasis by the MITRE ATT&CK Framework on the Collection tactic regarding access of data from a database. The specific technique for \u201cCollection\u201d is \u201cData from an information repository\u201d. Since databases are one of the two primary methods of storing data (in a database or a file), this tactic/technique should be considered more closely. Data does not exist in a vacuum. It is accessed/managed by applications in order to be useful. A key target of a hacker who wants to steal data is a database. There are many ways to collect such data \u2013 eavesdropping/man in the middle attacks of data in transit, capturing data at the point of collection (such as point of sale devices), exfiltrating files which contain sensitive data, etc. But the mother lode is the database. By watching how and what data is accessed from a database (as an \u201cauthorized\u201d user) it is possible to determine whether such access constitutes an attempted data theft. This is the equivalent of catching a bank robber in the vault. Recording Slide Deck I'll take ATT&CK techniques that can be done for $1000, Alex Ben Langrill, LLC How \"hard\" is it to do a given ATT&CK technique? Are they all the same? Clearly Phishing is a lot easier than Hardware additions for initial access. How many ATT&CK techniques can be done within a budget of say $1000? Answering these questions is a powerful step towards knowing what kinds of threats you will face. Building on the ATT&CKcon 4.0 Lightning Talk \"Adjectives for ATT&CK\", this presentation continues the work of organizing offensive techniques into levels of effort. This enables better training, prediction of adversary capabilities and imposing the maximum cost on threat actors.

Recording Slide Deck Grow Up! Evaluating and Maturing Your SOC using MITRE ATT&CK Lauren Brennan, GuidePoint Security Evaluating the maturity of your security operations program can be complex and challenging. From choosing the right framework to use, to understanding all aspects of how people, processes, and technologies can cohesively operate to grow your SOC, evaluating your security operations is crucial. This presentation will discuss how to evaluate your security operations program using the MITRE ATT&CK framework and talk about best practices for evaluations. We will explore how to identify gaps in your operations and improve your overall security posture with foundational activities. Attendees can expect to learn practical tips for leveraging the MITRE framework as well as actionable takeaways for evaluating and improving their own security operations. Recording Slide Deck Dealing with ATT&CK's Different Levels of Details Tareq Alkhatib, Lacework, Inc ATT&CK serves as the central language for CTI practitioners, Detection Engineers, Red Teamers, and more. Despite the benefit of having a central language, ATT&CK offers different levels of detail that might be useful for one team but not others. This paper points out some of these differences in the level of details available in ATT&CK, especially from the point of view of Detection Engineers, and focused on detection coverage.In summary, while ATT&CK does not define the Procedure level of the TTP trinity, it is still useful to define the \u201cDegrees of Freedom\u201d an attacker has within a technique. Some techniques only have a limited number of possible Procedures, some techniques might have more, and others might be so open ended that they offer an unlimited number of possible procedures per technique. We examine this concept on both the Technique and Tactic levels and make the argument that techniques that have a high number of possible Procedures cannot be covered by Detection Engineers.At the conference, we intend to release an ATT&CK Navigator layer to help Detection Engineers quickly filter out which Tactics and Techniques they need to focus on and which ones they simply cannot cover. Recording Slide Deck Tidying up your Nest: Validating ATT&CK Technique Coverage using EDR Telemetry Adam Ostrich and Jesse Brown, Red Canary Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) telemetry offers defenders a powerful tool for catching threats. However, understanding how to validate ATT&CK technique coverage using EDR telemetry can be a challenge. As Detection Validation Engineers at a Managed Detection & Response (MDR) provider that ingests nearly a petabyte of endpoint telemetry every day, we\u2019re in the unique and necessary position to analyze this telemetry at scale and validate its efficacy against common adversary tradecraft.After providing a brief introduction to EDR telemetry, we\u2019ll discuss how to break ATT&CK techniques down to individual data components, perform functional tests, analyze the ways that specific actions translate to telemetry records, and compare this analysis across different EDR sensors. We\u2019ll discuss the tooling we\u2019ve built to assist us in running these tests and analyzing the resulting telemetry, and we\u2019ll explain how security teams can improve their own functional testing efforts by creating an automated validation workflow. Finally, we\u2019ll describe how this approach has enabled us to more effectively understand and use EDR telemetry, highlighting where this telemetry excels and fails at detecting ATT&CK techniques.

Recording Slide Deck One Leg to Stand on: Adventures in Adversary Tracking with ATT&CK Nicole Hoffman and James Nutland, Cisco How many times have you added MITRE ATT&CK techniques to the end of a report and thought you could be doing more? Even though ATT&CK has become an industry standard for cyber threat intelligence reporting, all too often, techniques are thrown at the bottoms of reports and blogs without any context never to be seen again after dissemination. This is not useful for intelligence producers or consumers. Avast ye maties! Within this presentation, we are going to show analysts how they can use ATT&CK as a guideline for creating a contextual knowledge base for adversary tracking. Gone are the days of floundering about looking for information collected about a specific adversary or behavior. Gone are the days of wondering why the rum and context are always gone. Ahoy, me hearties! Hoist up the sails and prepare your sea legs for some swashbuckling adversary tales from the high seas where we will focus on the fickle commodity loader, Qakbot.

We will also explore key topics such as: \t(i)Customizing security training and awareness programs based on roles and responsibilities \t(ii)Conducting thorough assessments of incident response capabilities through the framework \t(iii)Integrating threat intelligence derived from ATT&CK to continuously improve the security posture Recording Slide Deck Using ATT&CK to Create Wicked Actors in Real Data Simeon Kakpovi and Greg Schloemer, KC7 Foundation KC7 uses an experiential learning pedagogy to teach cybersecurity analysis to students of all levels, from elementary school all the way to industry professionals. In the KC7 experience, students analyze realistic cybersecurity data and answer a series of CTF-style questions that guide them through an investigative journey. In order to generate authentic intrusion data, we create a fictional company that is attacked by cyber threat actors. The attributes and behaviors of these actors are defined via yaml configurations that are modeled based on MITRE ATT&CK categories and techniques. For example, we can granularly define what techniques an attacker uses for initial access or lateral movement, and how the actor explicitly uses those techniques.Students that effectively analyze KC7 intrusion data can map the observed activity to the various stages of the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Organizing actor definitions around the ATT&CK framework allows KC7 to create a rich set of intrusion data in various permutations - and ensure that students are exposed to a diverse array of scenarios. A pleasant byproduct of this methodology is that students of MITRE ATT&CK can now study techniques contextually in data rather than just reading about them in reports. Recording Slide Deck MITRE ATT&CK Updates: New Ideas in Enterprise - Pushing the boundaries of ATT&CK's long-established scope Patrick Howell O'Neill, MITRE ATT&CK Recording Slide Deck ATT&CK is the Best Defense - Emulating Sophisticated Adversary Malware to Bolster Defenses Sajal Thomas and Vishnu Raju, Crowdstrike Recording Slide Deck Detection as Code, Automation, and Testing: The Key to Unlocking the Power of Detection Engineering Olaf Harton, FalconForce Modern security teams have been engineering solid detections for a while now. All this great output also needs to be managed well. * How can we make sure that the detections we have spent a lot of time developing are deployed and are running in production in the same way as they were designed? * How can we assure our detection and prevention controls are still working and are detecting the attacks they have been designed to cover?We will show how we have built a robust and flexible development and deployment process using cloud technnologies. This process allows us to quickly and easily implement new detection controls, test them across multiple environments, and deploy them in a controlled and consistent manner.We will discuss how security teams can reap the benefits of using detection-as-code, and how this can help achieving a single source of truth for their detection logic. Adopting this approach enables teams to use automation and unit testing to manage and validate their detection controls across multiple environments and ensure proper documentation. By adopting a detection-as-code approach, teams can gain the confidence that comes from knowing that their detections and mitigations work as intended. Recording Slide Deck MITRE ATT&CK Updates: State of the Cloud Casey Knerr, MITRE ATT&CK Recording Slide Deck Driving Intelligence with MITRE ATT&CK: Leveraging Limited Resources to Build an Evolving Threat Repository Scott Roberts, Interpres Security Building threat intelligence is challenging, even under the most ideal circumstances. But what if you are even more limited in your resources? You are part of a small (but skilled) team, with high expectations, and people are relying on you to make business-critical decisions\u2026all the time! What do you do in that situation? Turn a Toyota Tercel into a tank, of course. The Interpres Security threat intelligence team found itself in that exact situation. Wanting to leverage the MITRE ATT&CK catalog in creating a comprehensive and timely threat intelligence repository, the Interpres team built a series of tools, processes, and paradigms that we call Intelligence Engineering. In this talk, we\u2019ll examine how we combined ATT&CK, STIX2, the Vertex Project\u2019s open-source intelligence platform, Synapse, and custom code to deliver meaningful, rapid, verifiable intelligence to our customers. We\u2019ll share lessons learned on automation, how to run multiple ATT&CK libraries side-by-side, and making programmatic intelligence delivery scalable and effective \u2013 just like building a tank out of an imported sedan. Recording Slide Deck Cloud Native Workload ATT&CK Matrix Matthew Mills and Nathaniel Beckstead and Ryan Simon, Datadog Cloud native computing has fundamentally changed traditional security methodologies and attack surfaces. This new architectural approach combines new operational tools and services like continuous integration, container engines, and orchestrators. Some organizations struggle to identify and respond to threats they specifically face when running cloud native workloads.Perimeter-centric security evangelizes defense-in-depth or the onion model to implement different layers of defense. Cloud native security hyper-focuses on four unique layers: Cloud, Clusters, Containers, and Code. Today's defenders have to look across several existing ATT&CK matrices including Linux Enterprise, Containers, Kubernetes, and IaaS to holistically evaluate and model threats or attack paths across the four distinct layers of cloud native workloads.In conclusion, we will discuss some of the challenges facing threat modeling cloud native workloads, including showing how to leverage several different ATT&CK matrices to create a distinct Cloud Native Workload ATT&CK matrix. The creation of this matrix will help defenders take the guesswork out of identifying what tactics serve as potential threats against a cloud native workload in order to enhance their defensive baseline and detection coverage. Recording Slide Deck MITRE ATT&CK based Threat Analysis for Electronic Flight Bag Ozan Olali, IBM Security The Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) has become an indispensable tool in modern aviation, providing pilots with digital resources and critical flight information. However, the increased reliance on EFB systems running on operating systems, introduces various security challenges. In this session, a technical assessment approach with MITRE ATT&CK framework to perform a comprehensive threat analysis of an EFB solution, will be presented. The potential attack vectors and relation with the risks for business/ flight operations will be demonstrated. Recording Slide Deck I Can Haz Cake: Benefits of Working with MITRE on ATT&CK Tim Wadhwa-Brown, Cisco The purpose of this session will be to look at how the linux-malware repo came to take shape and how we've used it to inform our view on adversarial behaviour over the last couple of years. Since the original reason for staring this project was to look at Linux coverage in ATT&CK, we'll play back some of the interesting points and reflect on how they've affected ATT&CK itself. Recording Slide Deck Updates from the Center for Threat-Informed Defense Jon Baker, MITRE Engenuity Center for Threat-Informed Defense Recording Slide Deck Lightning Talk: The case for quishing Brian Donohue, Red Canary Despite an absurd (or maybe disgusting) name, quishing is emerging as an undeniable risk to organizations. Sure, it's offered adversaries an avenue for initial access for many years, and, yes, public reporting on such incidents has been somewhat underwhelming. However, QR codes are officially ubiquitous, people are extremely comfortable with them, and, in the coming years, quishing is bound to become a powerful and reliable weapon in the arsenal of sophisticated adversaries. In 5 minutes of compelling and persuasive speech, I'll make the case for why Quishing deserves to be a standalone sub-technique of phishing in the enterprise ATT&CK\u00ae matrix. Recording Slide Deck Lightning Talk: Enhancing Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) Impact with MITRE ATT&CK and LLMs Jose Barajas, AttackIQ The evolving complexity and sophistication of cyber threats necessitate a robust and automated approach to threat report analysis and mapping. Leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs) in conjunction with the MITRE ATT&CK framework can dramatically streamline this process. We, at AttackIQ, are developing a process leveraging LLMs to not only extract the ATT&CK tactics and techniques from cyber threat reports, but also parsing the equally crucial information such as the command line snippets, implementation methodology, image-to-text conversions, etc. in order to significantly reduce the amount of time and manpower spent in threat report mapping while enabling the teams to focus on more critical aspects of BAS scenario development. Recording Lightning Talk: Discussion on Finding Relationships in Cyber Data Stephen Johnson and Emma MacMullan, Capital One Capital One is currently building a Security Graph to tie together various Cyber Teams and their data -- Controls, Objectives, Tools, and Countermeasures, Threats. It is an ambitious project that will help us identify gaps and focus our controls on the most likely and persistent threats. It is a work in progress that is using MITRE ATT&CK and D3FEND as a \"lingua franca\" to tie together the elements of the graph, so we have a common understanding across the enterprise. Recording Slide Deck Lightning Talk: ATT&CK STIX mapping challenges Jason Keirstead, Cyware MITRE provides a set of robust STIX objects that implement the entire ATT&CK matrix (it is actually the reference data). However, there is a challenge as there is no official recommended way from MITRE on how someone should REFERENCE these objects inside their own STIX data. As a result, vendors amd threat providers have created many incompatible ways to reference ATT&CK techniques. We will show a few examples of this, talk about how it creates challenges, and suggest a path forward for the community. Recording Lightning Talk: Adjectives for ATT&CK Benjamin Langrill, Security Optimizer If you tell me an attacker performed OS Credential Dumping, did they dump credentials with meterpreter, recompile mimikatz, or use a custom tool? The technique reference lacks a way to categorize how they performed the action and each type requires its own mitigation. In this talk, Ben Langirll will propose formal adjectives for ATT&CK techniques that map to adversary capabilities and how we can use them to optimize defensive choices. Recording Slide Deck Lightning Talk: Of Lenses and Layers Andrew Malone, JetBlue Many use the ATT&CK matrix to map tool coverage across the environment. This blanket coverage is a good baseline but it can miss certain aspects of the enterprise's context like risk levels, organisational priorities, and industry specific threat intelligence. I want to discuss ways to layer these lenses on top of an enterprise mapping to make ATT&CK more relevant to the specific enterprise. If done right this can lead to more actionable metrics and reporting on improvements. Recording Slide Deck Lightning Talk: ATT&CK\u2019s Adoption in CTI: A Great Success (with Room to Grow!) Scott Small, Tidal Cyber This metrics- and meme-based lightning session spotlights the success story that is the CTI industry\u2019s impressive (and expanding) adoption of ATT&CK in their products. Using nearly 6 years\u2019 worth of ATT&CK-mapped, public threat reports collected from government, vendor, & independent sources, we\u2019ll show how the rate (and detail) of mapping has increased considerably, while showcasing (anonymized) examples of high-quality end-products, with the aim of inspiring further ATT&CK adoption in this important corner of the field. Recording Slide Deck Lightning Talk: Automating testing by implementing ATT&CK using the Blackboard Architecture Jeremy Straub, NDSU Cybersecurity Institute This presentation will briefly summarize work that we've done regarding implementing the ATT&CK framework as a rule-fact-action network within a Blackboard Architecture, allowing the ATT&CK framework to enable security testing automation. The presentation will start with a quick summary of the concept behind this and then present a few implementation examples. Recording Slide Deck Sponsors "

"path": "/resources/attackcon/october-2020/index.html",
"content": " ATT&CKcon Power Hour Thank you to everyone who attended and spoke as ATT&CKcon went virtual in 2020. Broken into a series of four 1.5 hour virtual sessions, ATT&CKcon Power Hour talks have been viewed over 12,000 times. ATT&CKcon Power Hour brought us talks on areas of ATT&CK we haven't heard about before such as Cloud and Mobile as well as insights on how organizations are adapting to features such as sub-techniques. Please continue to watch and share these talks! Presentations Starting Over with Sub-Techniques: Lessons Learned Remapping Detection Analytics Brian Donohue, Red Canary In early 2018, Red Canary adopted MITRE ATT&CK as the common language that they would use to categorize threats, measure detection coverage, and communicate about malicious behaviors. In the intervening years, they\u2019ve relied on the framework to develop open source tools like Atomic Red Team and help security teams prioritize their defensive efforts with blogs and our annual Threat Detection Report. In early 2020, MITRE announced that ATT&CK would be expanding its original taxonomy of tactics and techniques to include sub-techniques. In the months that followed MITRE's announcement, Red Canary\u2019s research, intelligence, and detection engineering teams painstakingly remapped their library of thousands of behavioral analytics to sub-techniques. In doing so, they improved their correlational logic, experimented with the idea of conditional technique mapping, and, unfortunately, rendered the 2020 Threat Detection Report out-of-date. In this talk from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session on October 9, 2020, Brian discusses how refactoring for sub-techniques offered us the opportunity to apply all the lessons learned in more than two years of operationalizing ATT&CK. He also explores how Red Canary has remodeled its ATT&CK mapping to allow for added flexibility and human input and shows what happens when the Red Canary applied their new sub-technique mappings to the 2020 Threat Detection Report. Recording Slide Deck Using MITRE PRE-ATT&CK and ATT&CK In Cybercrime Education and Research Aunshul Rege and Rachel Bleiman, Temple University This presentation from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session on October 9, 2020, explores the application of the MITRE ATT&CK and PRE-ATT&CK matrices in cybercrime education and research. Specifically, Rege and Bleiman demonstrate the mapping of the PRE-ATT&CK matrix to social engineering case studies as an experiential learning project in an upper-level cybercrime liberal arts course. It thus allows students to understand the alignment process of threat intelligence to the PRE-ATT&CK framework and also learn about its usefulness/limitations. The talk also discusses the mapping of the ATT&CK matrix, tactics, techniques, software, and groups for two cybercrime datasets created by collating publicly disclosed incidents: (i) critical infrastructure ransomware (CIRW) incidents, and (ii) social engineering (SE) incidents. For the CIRW dataset, 39% of the strains mapped onto the ATT&CK software. For the SE dataset, 49% of the groups and 65% of the techniques map on to the MITRE framework. This helps the researchers identify the framework's usefulness/limitations and also helps our datasets connect to richer information that may not otherwise be available in the publicly disclosed incidents. Recording Slide Deck Without Attacking: Transforming Adversary Emulations Into A Data Analysis Question Matan Hart, Cymptom Adversary emulation is commonly used to validate security controls and is considered one of the most popular use-cases for the ATT&CK framework. However, emulating adversary TTPs on production environments is often very limited in testing scope and frequency, and such practice may cause unwanted business disruption. In this talk from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session on October 9, 2020, Hart presents a different approach to testing controls against ATT&CK. He demonstrates how it is possible to provide data-based methods to evaluate the exploitability of ATT&CK techniques by gathering information from the network, endpoint, and services; this unique approach does not emulate any sort of malicious action, thus reducing the potential of causing business disruption to the minimum. Hart also outlines a new open-source guideline based on ATT&CK mitigations, that security teams can use to assess their security posture non-intrusively and at scale. Recording Slide Deck Detecting ATT&CK's With Dynamic Thresholds Using Tukey\u2019s Test and Azure Sentinel Jair Santanna, Northwave How do you detect abnormal activities based on frequency, for example, a suspicious number of sign-ins (leading to a brute force attack), suspicious amount of data transfer (leading to a data exfiltration), and malicious scanning or discovering activities? Usually, you would count the frequency of the activity and if this number exceeds a pre-defined threshold then you would consider it abnormal/attack. The problem here is the definition of this threshold (and the reduction of false positives and negatives). Some practitioners set this threshold to 5, others to 10, and in some situations, to 30 or even higher. The remaining question is how to obtain a statistically sounding threshold? In this talk from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session on October 9, 2020, Jair Santanna answers this question by using a half-century-old statistical method to define such a dynamic threshold (John Tukey\u2019s \"honestly significant difference\"-HSD). Northwave has implemented this method in a production environment over several ATT&CK techniques using the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) from Microsoft, Azure Sentinel. Northwave\u2019s scripts are publicly available. In this presentation, Santanna sheds light on dynamic thresholds for security monitoring and discuss how to move forward with this challenging old problem. Recording Ta505 - A Study of High End Big Game Hunting In 2020 Brandon Levene, Google Opportunistically targeted ransomware deployments, aka Big Game Hunting (BGH), have caused a distinct disruption in the mechanics of monetizing crimeware compromises. This strategy has become the \u201cend game\u201d for the majority of organized cybercrime organizations, and one effect of this shift is the increased emphasis on enterprise-level targets. In this talk from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session on October 9, 2020, Levene walks us through research about how a specific BGH threat actor pursues entry points, gains its foothold, pivots, and deploys payloads to maximize their financial gains with minimal effort - and infrastructure! You\u2019ll walk away with an understanding of the latest BGH TTPs seen in enterprise environments, and how they map to the ATT&CK framework so you can build this research into your threat detection strategy and enhance your defenses. Recording Slide Deck What\u2019s New with ATT&CK for Cloud? Jack Burns, MITRE Jack Burns is a Lead Cybersecurity Engineer at MITRE and the Lead for MITRE ATT&CK for Cloud. He\u2019s also a red team developer and lead for ATT&CK Evaluations, using his skills in software engineering and adversary emulation. Previously, he was a tech lead at HubSpot on the Infrastructure Security team where he focused on red teaming and building detections in the cloud environment. This presentation is from the MITRE ATT&Ckcon Power Hour session held on October 9, 2020. Recording Slide Deck Mapping The Eventbot Mobile Banking Trojan With MITRE ATT&CK For Mobile Allie Mellen, Cybereason In this presentation from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session on November 12, Allie discusses how the Cybereason research team uses both MITRE ATT&CK and MITRE ATT&CK for Mobile to map and communicate new malware to the larger security community. Teams use the MITRE ATT&CK framework to share techniques, tactics, and procedures with their team and the community at large. This knowledge base has been incredibly beneficial for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community. Many of these uses have centered around traditional endpoints like laptops and workstations. However, the MITRE ATT&CK team has also created a cutting-edge portion of their framework: MITRE ATT&CK for Mobile. One of the most recent pieces of malware they have found is EventBot, a mobile banking trojan that targets Android devices and the financial services applications on them, including popular apps like Paypal Business, Revolut, Barclays, UniCredit, CapitalOne UK, HSBC UK, Santander UK, TransferWise, Coinbase, paysafecard, and many more. In this talk, learn about this specific attack, intended targets, a timeline of the attack, and the MITRE ATT&CK for Mobile mapping. Learn why the Cybereason team map to MITRE ATT&CK and MITRE ATT&CK for Mobile and what benefits it has given them and their interactions with the community. Recording Slide Deck ATT&CKing The Cloud: Hopping Between The Matrices Anthony Randazzo, Expel The team at Expel has been migrating to the cloud for the last 10 years, but as usual, security has lagged behind. Which means we don't have a comprehensive detection and response framework for cloud like we do with the Enterprise ATT&CK matrix. Cloud has evolved into a complex beast as technologies and concepts - like Infrastructure As Code, Containers, Kubernetes and so forth - have emerged. These new attack surfaces have been added that introduce additional challenges to detection and response in our cloud environments. We don't know what we don't know about attack life cycles in the cloud. In this presentation from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session on November 12, 2020, Anthony shares some interesting lessons learned so far when it comes to finding bad guys in the cloud. Recording Slide Deck Building Detections For Cloud With KQL and ATT&CK Nitya Garg, LinkedIn Writing and deploying custom detections with high efficacy is one of the most important goals of any SIRT team. It involves multiple stages, starting from developing a detection hypothesis, to writing the detection query, and validating it against a simulated true positive scenario. With ever-changing threat landscape and hybrid cloud environments, the process can be intensive and overwhelming. In this presentation from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session on November 12, 2020, Nitya talks about how we can leverage MITRE ATT&CK to not only simplify detection engineering but make it more efficient. The presentation will also include a demo on how to build a detection query, written in KQL(Kusto Query Languauge), for an ATT&CK technique from MITRE Cloud Matrix. Recording What\u2019s a MITRE with Your Security? Matt Snyder, VMWare The market for Security products is flooded with vendors offering all sorts of solutions, and organizations are spending a record amount of money defending their environments. Nevertheless, an increasing number of breaches are reported each year, resulting in organizations spending millions of dollars to remediate them. The Security industry responds with more products, all offering to stop the next breach, and the cycle continues. In this presentation from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session on November 12, 2020, Matt discusses what VMware is doing internally to address this fundamental flaw in the Security industry and how they are leveraging the MITRE ATT&CK framework to reshape how we think about security. Recording Slide Deck Putting the PRE into ATT&CK Jamie Williams and Mike Hartley, MITRE In this presentation from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session on November 12, 2020 Jamie Williams and Mike Hartley from MITRE discuss the process for merging PRE-ATT&CK and adding two new tactics to Enterprise ATT&CK - Reconnaissance and Resource Development. Recording Slide Deck Helping Small Companies Leverage CTI with an Open Source Threat Mapping Valentina Palac\u00edn, Senior Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst No one can deny the tremendous impact that ATT&CK had on the cybersecurity industry, nor the usefulness of having a good Threat Library at your disposal. But the question Valentina gets asked over and over by people from small companies is always the same: \u201cHow could I leverage threat intelligence using ATT&CK with limited time and resources?\u201d And so far, there hasn't been a good answer. That\u2019s why she decided to come up with the Threat Mapping Catalogue (TMC), a tool that combines the power of the mappings already available in the ATT&CK website, TRAM and the ATT&CK Navigator, to better process, consume and incorporate new mappings while organizing them around different categories. This talk is from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session held on December 11, 2020. Recording Slide Deck From Theory to Practice: How My ATT&CK Perspectives Have Changed Katie Nickels, Red Canary Good analysts (and good human beings) change their minds based on new information. In this presentation, Katie will share how her perspectives on ATT&CK have changed since moving from ATT&CK team member to ATT&CK end-user. She will discuss how her ideas about coverage, procedures, and detection creation have evolved and why those perspectives matter. Katie will also share practical examples from observed threats to help explain the nuances of her perspectives. Attendees should expect to leave this presentation with a better understanding of how to handle challenges they\u2019re likely to face when navigating their own ATT&CK journey. This talk is from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session held on December 11, 2020. Recording Slide Deck Sharpening Your Threat Hunting Program with ATT&CK Framework Hieu Tran, FPT Cybersecurity Division No matter how sophisticated and thorough your security precautions may be, you cannot assume your security measures are impenetrable. This is why you need a threat hunting program in place. But how can we implement a proper threat hunting program and run it efficiently? In this talk, we will uncover how to sharpen your threat hunting strategy by leveraging ATT&CK. Ultimately, we\u2019ll be demonstrating how effectively employing the hunting methodology in the real-world battlefield, fighting against well-known cyber espionage actors who strongly focus on Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam, the Philippines, Laos, and Cambodia. This talk is from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session held on December 11, 2020. Recording Slide Deck Using ATT&CK To Create Cyber DBTs For Nuclear Power Plants Jacob Benjamin, Dragos Design Basis Threat (DBT) is a concept introduced by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). It is a profile of the type, composition, and capabilities of an adversary. DBT is the key input nuclear power plants use for the design of systems against acts of radiological sabotage and theft of special nuclear material. The NRC expects its licensees, nuclear power plants, to demonstrate that they can defend against the DBT. Currently, cyber is included in DBTs simply as a prescribed list of IT centric security controls. Using MITRE\u2019s ATT&CK framework, Cyber DBTs can be created that are specific to the facility, its material, or adversary activities. This talk is from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session held on December 11, 2020. Recording Slide Deck What\u2019s New with ATT&CK for ICS? Otis Alexander, MITRE Otis Alexander is a Principal Cyber Security Engineer at the MITRE Corporation and has worked in the areas of security engineering and research, analytic development, and adversary modeling and emulation. Otis is a co-creator of ATT&CK for ICS and has been leading the project since its inception. He also leads an effort to bring MITRE ATT&CK Evaluations to ICS security vendors providing anomaly and threat detection solutions. He advocates for network and host visibility in operational technology environments to increase the situational awareness of defenders. This talk is from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session held on December 11, 2020. Recording Slide Deck Measure What Matters: How to Use ATT&CK to Do the Right Things in the Right Order Daniel Wyleczuk-Stern, Snowflake Cyber security is inherently a function of risk management. Risk management is the identification, evaluation, and prioritization of risks followed by the effort to reduce those risks in a coordinated and economical manner (thanks wikipedia!). In this talk, Daniel will be going over some strategies for measuring and prioritizing your cyber risks using MITRE ATT&CK . He'll discuss some lessons learned in atomic testing of techniques vs attack chaining as well as what to measure and how to make decisions with that data. This talk is from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session held on January 14, 2021. Recording Slide Deck ATT&CKers Think in Graphs Valentine Mairet, McAfee The MITRE ATT&CK framework is the industry standard to dissect cyberattacks into used techniques. At McAfee, all attack information is disseminated into different categories, including ATT&CK techniques. What results from this exercise is an extensive repository of techniques used in cyberattacks that goes back many years. Much can be learned from looking at historical attack data, but how can we piece all this information together to identify new relationships between threats and attacks? In her recent efforts, Valentine has embraced analyzing ATT&CK data in graphical representations. One lesson learned is that it is not just about merely mapping out attacks and techniques used into graphs, but the strength lies in applying different algorithms to answer specific questions. In this presentation, Valentine will showcase the results and techniques obtained from her research journey using graph and graph algorithms. This talk is from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session held on January 14, 2021. Recording Slide Deck ATT&CK-Onomics: Exploring the Economics Behind Techniques Used By Adversaries Gert-Jan Bruggink, FalconForce Adversaries are humans as well. They have objectives, deadlines and resources for programming. In a sense, very similar to corporations grounded in the economics of effort vs time vs results. Now understanding techniques is one thing, taking it a step further and understanding what the economic impact is of using certain techniques is another. Developing tools takes time. For example, developing a custom process injection module might take days or weeks to develop, where using an open source tool could prevent extensive development costs incurred. This talk explores the economic considerations for defending against techniques used by adversaries. It explores fundamental considerations all referenced to MITRE\u2019s ATT&CK framework. The objective of this talk is to inspire defensive strategies designed to impact cost incurred by adversaries to perform compromises. This talk is from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session held on January 14, 2021. Recording Slide Deck State of the ATT&CK Adam Pennington, MITRE In this presentation from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour held on January 14, 2021, MITRE ATT&CK lead Adam Pennington gives an update on the current and future state of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Presentations Advancing Infosec, Keynote Presentation John Lambert, Microsoft In this presentation at MITRE ATT&CKcon, John Lambert, Distinguished Engineer and General Manager of the Threat Intelligence Center at Microsoft, presents \u201cAdvancing InfoSec: Towards an Open, Shareable, Contributor-Friendly Model of Speeding InfoSec Learning.\u201d The talk details a model where infosec know-how is more organized, community sourced, vendor neutral, and shareable by all defenders. It includes a call for the community to publish mappings of ATT&CK techniques used by groups. Recording Slide Deck How Did We Get Here? Blake Strom and Richard Struse, MITRE Richard Struse, MITRE\u2019s Principal Strategist for Cyber Threat Intelligence, interviews Blake Strom, MITRE\u2019s principal ATT&CK engineer, on how MITRE ATT&CK was developed, its current state, and future direction. Recording Operationalizing ATT&CK Bryson Bort, SCYTHE How do you turn a theoretical framework into something useful? ATT&CK provides a common language while allowing for the development of sophisticated defenses. Recording Slide Deck Summiting the Pyramid of Pain: Operationalizing ATT&CK Emma MacMullan and Justin Sherenco, General Electric Operationalizing the ATT&CK framework has enabled GE to deploy custom detection to evolving threat actor behaviors. By leveraging an in-house developed tool called TIAMAT (Tactical Intelligence Adversary Mapping and Analysis Tool) the ATT&CK framework is incorporated into an end-to-end operational process from intelligence collection to customized detection deployment. The designing of this new operational process is examined, and a use case presented of how examining a historical incident led to a new method of deploying detection based on ATT&CK and the detection of previously undiscovered activity. There is also a demo that walks the audience through the end-to-end process and explains TIAMATs capabilities. Recording Slide Deck ATT&CK: All the Things Neelsen Cyrus and David Thompson, USAA USAA has utilized the ATT&CK framework as a unique means to map their current detection infrastructure and assess their ability to defend against the most relevant threats to their network. In this presentation they share some lessons learned during their journey with ATT&CK leading to identified best practices for workflow integration through team composition and custom tool development. Recording Slide Deck Agile Continuous Improvement Using ATT&CK Matthew Stiak and Jason Sinchak, Level Nine Group Organizations implementing SOC/IR with limited resources confront two issues: prioritization and measurement. Any successful SOC/IR implementation must have a robust way to prioritize content development and technology investment, and measurements that reflect the effectiveness of the investments to drive the next round of prioritization. Organizations can maximize their return on investment by using MITRE ATT&CK to focus resources on repeatable behaviors and provide a simple structure to reporting how well the organization can detect, block, or respond to those behaviors. During this talk security testing and operations experts Matt Stiak and Jason Sinchak share their thoughts on how to operationalize a continuous improvement and measurement framework based on MITRE ATT&CK, as well as some early results from their implementation of that framework. Recording Slide Deck Vendor Panel Discussion Moderated by Ed Amoroso, TAG Cyber Panelists: Devon Kerr, Endgame Jen Miller-Osborn, Unit 42 at Palo Alto Networks Ross Rustici, Cybereason Carl Wright, ATTACKIQ Ed Amoroso moderates a panel that discusses: The role of a threat taxonomy in the design of a commercial solution How commercial providers keep up with a changing threat landscape Stories around the most intriguing threat scenarios or methods seen Requirements from commercial clients regarding threat frameworks Recording VCAF: Expanding the ATT&CK Framework to cover VERIS Threat Action Varieties Alex Pinto, Verizon The Vocabulary for Event Recording and Incident Sharing (VERIS) is a set of metrics designed to provide a common language for describing security incidents in a structured and repeatable manner. VERIS has been the base analysis framework for supporting the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) since its inception. However, as organizations work to interpret the richness of information present on the DBIR to a more tactical level, the Threat Action Varieties available on VERIS fail to capture the detail present on the incidents recorded. This talk presents the Verizon Common Attack Framework (VCAF), an effort from the Security Data Science team and the DBIR team in Verizon to expand and map the ATT&CK framework in alignment with the DBIR Threat Action Varieties to provide this much-sought level of granularity in recording and analyzing recorded breaches. Additionally, this talk describes possible outcomes when this data is available and organized as such. Examples include applying DBIR-inspired attack vector analytics upon ATT&CK layer information, effectively identifying optimal control choke points on the attack graphs according to specific industries covered by the DBIR. Recording Slide Deck Playing Devil\u2019s Advocate to Security Initiatives with ATT&CK David Middlehurst, Trustwave This talk presents a case study which demonstrates that we should consider the knowledge and wisdom contained within ATT&CK in all organizational security initiatives to make sure by fixing one thing we have not just created an opportunity. The presentation shows how to leverage the analysis and classification of APT tactics and procedures (TTP) to guide research into new and novel techniques, specifically focusing on exfiltration and command and control. DNS over HTTPS (DoH) aims to increase user privacy and security by preventing eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS data by man-in-the-middle attacks. Major web browsers such as Firefox are considering its implementation by default. But what could this possibly mean for exfiltration and command and control? This session provides an end-to-end demo that shows DoH being implemented to provide full command and control in a popular attack simulation framework and discusses associated mitigations. Recording Slide Deck From Red VS Blue to Red Loves Blue Olaf Hartong and Vincent Van Mieghem, Deloitte This session discusses Deloitte\u2019s purple teaming approach which is using ATT&CK as a guiding principle to help both teams improve. This session shows how this works in a customer scenario, how to scope that scenario, how to plan the scenario and choose the various TTPs to be covered to how we assist the customers blue team in understanding the TTPs and helping them design detective capabilities for them. When the Blue Team is able to connect the dots from offensive activities in the network and what they see in their logs, rewalls, SIEMs, etc. they have the ability to fully understand what adversaries do and what the TTP\u2019s of attackers actually look like if they are active in their network. It\u2019s much easier to find the needle in the haystack if you know there is a needle to find to begin with. Purple teaming is providing this pointy needle, used to accelerate the Blue Team. Recording Slide Deck Helping Your Non-Security Executives Understand ATT&CK in 10 Minutes or Less Elly Searle, CrowdStrike ATT&CK is an incredibly valuable framework for describing and analyzing what\u2019s happening in your environment. Sometimes security professionals not only need a way to understand, but also need a way to clearly articulate to non-security leadership to gain support and investment in needed resourcing. Using UX design methods, CrowdStrike came up with a mental model and more conversational terms to help anyone quickly parse the big picture. Recording Slide Deck ATT&CK as a Teacher Travis Smith, Tripwire ATT&CK is valuable for those of us who are heads down in security day in and day out. But what about using ATT&CK to each college interns about security? This presentation details how Tripwire used ATT&CK to build- out a new training regimen for summer interns. By going through and finding quick wins, Tripwire\u2019s interns were actively engaged in learning about security. The detailed break downs of ATT&CK were greatly beneficial in helping teach security concepts to those who were not yet familiar with them. This session shows the program details and how you might be able to adapt it to your requirements. Recording Slide Deck Detection Philosophy, Evolution & ATT&CK Fred Stankowski and Travis McWaters, Pepsico This lightning talk is a brief discussion around how PepsiCo is managing their \u2018detection catalog\u2019 and how it maps and is enhanced by the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Recording Slide Deck Decision Analysis Applications in Threat Analysis Frameworks Emily Shawgo, PNC In the modern age, all organizations face threats from various types of cyber attacks. Although great strides have been made to consider human factors in cybersecurity and to become more proactive in threat analysis, security is still generally a reactive, technical field. The research presented in this talk seeks to develop a framework which adapts the existing MITRE ATT&CK framework to look at attacks in a less linear, more human-centered framework that focuses on the capabilities and decisions of the threat actor. The framework approaches threat analysis from a binary assessment of success vs. failure in order to see the entire attack and consider the potential for a number of methods and attempts made in a single attack. A detailed methodology and sample charts are included for a reference and a starting point in developing one\u2019s own personalized charts, and recommendations are made for ways to integrate this methodology into the risk management process. Recording Slide Deck Building an Atomic Testing Program Brian Beyer, Red Canary Red Canary\u2019s applied research team built the Atomic Red Team project based on a simple idea: encourage security teams to test their systems. Leveraging MITRE ATT&CK, the series of small tests can be combined into chains to help teams gain insight into gaps in their security program at all levels. This talk describes how to use Atomic Red Team and how MITRE ATT&CK is leveraged to write the tests. Recording Slide Deck 5 Ways to Screw Up Your Security Program with ATT&CK Kyle Rainey, Red Canary Over the past year there has been a significant uptick in adoption of MITRE ATT&CK. Adoption of a common language and taxonomy for adversarial tactics and techniques comes with a few unspoken traps. This talk is to bring awareness to the pitfalls of implementing and adopting any variation of MITRE ATT&CK and how you can avoid falling for them. Recording ATT&CK + OSQuery = Love Scott Lundgren, Carbon Black MITRE ATT&CK is cool and it's open, with a heavy emphasis on how attackers behave on the endpoint. OSQuery is cool and it's open, with a heavy emphasis on endpoint visibility. This talk focuses on an open-source extension to OSQuery that provides a free, repeatable mechanism to identify and detect ATT&CK techniques. Recording Slide Deck An ATT&CK Review of 200 Hybrid-Analysis Submissions James Lerud, Verodin How can you consistently categorize Techniques a given piece of malware uses? The answer to this question could be provided by sandbox vendors. CrowdStrike has embraced ATT&CK by including Technique detection in their public Hybrid-Analysis reports. This talk reviews the submission results of 100 malicious and 100 benign executables. Recording Slide Deck From Technique to Detection Paul Ewing and Ross Wolf, Endgame This session is a practical guide for a rapid prototyping of ATT&CK-based analytics \u2013 from technique to detection. Recording Slide Deck Hunters ATT&CKing with the Data Roberto Rodriguez, SpecterOps; Jose Luis Rodriguez, Student With the development of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and its categorization of adversary activity during the attack cycle, understanding what to hunt for has become easier and more efficient than ever. However, organizations are still struggling to understand how they can prioritize the development of hunt hypothesis, assess their current security posture, and develop the right analytics with the help of ATT&CK. Even though there are several ways to utilize ATT&CK to accomplish those goals, there are only a few that are focusing primarily on the data that is currently being collected to drive the success of a hunt program. This presentation shows how organizations can benefit from mapping their current visibility from a data perspective to the ATT&CK framework. It focuses on how to identify, document, standardize and model current available data to enhance a hunt program. It presents an updated ThreatHunter-Playbook, a Kibana ATT&CK dashboard, a new project named Open Source Security Events Metadata known as OSSEM and expands on the \u201cdata sources\u201d section already provided by ATT&CK on most of the documented adversarial techniques. Recording Slide Deck Analyzing Targeted Intrusions Through the Lens of the ATT&CK Framework Karl Scheuerman, CrowdStrike The security community is quickly adopting the MITRE ATT&CK matrix as a framework for understanding and analyzing targeted intrusions. However, one of its potential limitations is a lack of detailed historical intrusion data for developing accurate and thorough ATT&CK-based threat modeling. Crowdstrike\u2019s Falcon OverWatch threat hunting team analyzes adversary behavior on a regular basis. The amount of OverWatch's malicious intrusion data is significant given the valuable telemetry delivered by Falcon's endpoint technology. As a result, CrowdStrike has amassed a rich data library of malicious activity that can be applied to the ATT&CK model. The OverWatch Strategic Counter-Adversary Research (SCAR) team has now evaluated all OverWatch intrusion data since January 1, 2018 through the lens of the ATT&CK framework. This presentation presents these findings and highlights cases of unique adversary TTP use. The results of this analysis will provide a baseline from which CrowdStrike can better identify changes in threat actor TTP trends moving forward. In addition, the presentation discusses limitations in this type of research. Recording End User Panel Disussion Moderated by Katie Nickels, MITRE Panelists: Jon Bagg, Booz Allen Hamilton Daniel Bernholz, JPMorgan Chase Dave Westgard, Target Corporation Katie Nickels moderates a panel that discusses: What are the best practices and lessons learned for organizations who are just getting started with ATT&CK? What has been the most difficult part of implementing ATT&CK? What changes could be made to ATT&CK to make it easier for others in the future? Where would you like to see ATT&CK go in the future that would help make it more useful for your team? What else haven\u2019t we talked about that you think is important for someone who wants to use ATT&CK to know? Recording Sofacy 2018 and the Adversary Playbook Robert Falcone, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researches threat activity and publishes detailed reports on attack campaigns launched by these adversaries. One of these adversaries, known as Sofacy, has been carrying out attack campaigns on high profile targets for many years and has continued into 2018. To understand how to defend against these threats, an analyst has to read our reports, process them and mentally map them to their defenses. In most cases we expect readers just \"block\" all of the indicators we include in the report and assume they are covered. Last year we started using ATT&CK to codify the techniques we observed, linking those techniques to indicator patterns and encoding them into STIX 2 objects, with the goal of creating something that a defender can use to answer the question: \"How am I defending against this adversary?\" We call these documents, \"Adversary Playbooks\" as they contain our best approximation of how the adversary launches their attacks. This talk describes the concept of Adversary Playbooks, as well as provides an overview of the attack campaigns Unit 42 has attributed to the Sofacy group in 2018. It uses the discussed attacks to show how these playbooks are constructed and explain some of the challenges of incorporating ATT&CK and STIX 2 together for this purpose. Recording Slide Deck From Automation to Analytics: Simulating the Adversary to Create Better Detections David Herrald and Ryan Kovar, Splunk Security teams have more detection tools at their disposal than ever before, yet most are still struggling to find even the most basic malicious activity occurring in their environments. Building effective detection analytics requires realistic data and the ability to iterate quickly in a rapid analytic development cycle. This talk introduces a full lifecycle attack simulation and analytics development environment featuring the MITRE ATT&CK framework and the Atomic Red Team project using Splunk and Splunk Phantom mapped to an imaginary APT group, Taedonggang. It focuses on how security teams can use such a system to rapidly develop and share new detection analytics. Links to all components referenced in the talk are provided, including a cloud-based dataset that can act as a playground for users who want to see the results of the activity. Recording Slide Deck The Use of Game Theory with MITRE ATT&CK Matt Summers and Nick Dunn, NCC Group This presentation shows how the use of game theory with the ATT&CK framework can produce better attack and defense strategies.

Recording The Friends We Made Along the Way, Keynote Address Toni Gidwani, Google In the keynote from ATT&CKcon 2.0, Toni Gidwani from Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group presents \"The Friends We Made Along the Way.\" The talk focuses on the purpose of intelligence, to create a decision advantage, and the partnerships that are necessary to achieve that purpose. Recording Slide Deck State of the ATT&CK Blake Strom, MITRE MITRE ATT&CK Lead Blake Strom updates the community on what\u2019s new in ATT&CK since ATT&CKcon 2018 and some of what to expect in the coming year. This talk includes details on ATT&CK for Cloud, the new Impact Tactic, structured mitigations, and the upcoming shift to sub-techniques. Recording Slide Deck Using Threat Intelligence to Focus ATT&CK Activities David Westin and Andy Kettell, Nationwide In October 2018, Nationwide began its MITRE ATT&CK journey. Nationwide looked at a number of different approaches to getting started, but it wasn\u2019t until they prioritized efforts based on threat actors likely to target the finance/insurance industry that things started to click. Ultimately, Nationwide focused on 27 high concern threat actors targeting their industry, reducing the overall number of techniques from 240+ to 91. With this manageable chunk of techniques, Nationwide was able to test, analyze, and provide recommendations for improving its detection and mitigation capabilities. Nationwide is continuing to keep threat actor focus at the heart of its ATT&CK efforts, leading to prioritization of remediation actions, integration into penetration testing, and selection of security tools. Recording Slide Deck Prioritizing ATT&CK Informed Defenses the CIS Way Philippe Langlois, Verizon DBIR; Joshua Franklin, Center for Internet Security In a world of limited resources, organizations have to be strategic and meticulous in their planning and selection of security controls and the MITRE ATT&CK model has become an important piece for categorizing and understanding adversary techniques and contextualizing our own defenses. However, there still underlies a difficult question, where should organizations start and how should they prioritize their cybersecurity efforts? Join CIS as we explore our attempt to tackle this problem through the use of our community, content and real-world threat data collected as part of the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC). Participants should look forward to learning how to prioritize their security efforts and leverage the process for their own data and threats. Recording Slide Deck Alertable Techniques for Linux using ATT&CK Tony Lambert, Red Canary Community members continually ask, should I have detection capabilities across every technique in ATT&CK? This question inevitably leads to the same conclusion that not every technique is alertable and not all of them provide the same value for immediate detection. In this session we\u2019ll discuss the concept of alertable detections using Linux ATT&CK techniques as a case study. We\u2019ll introduce decision criteria we\u2019ve learned through experience to illustrate the challenges, and we\u2019ll recommend specific techniques that work well with an alert-driven workflow. Recording Slide Deck ATT&CK Updates \u2013 TRAM Jackie Lasky and Sarah Yoder, MITRE Updates from the ATT&CK Team's very own Jackie Lasky and Sarah Yoder covering Threat Report ATT&CK Mapping (TRAM). Recording Slide Deck Raiders of the MITRE Framework: How to Build Your Own Threat Library Valentina Palacin and Ruth Esmeralda Barbacil, Deloitte It's the year 2019 and the internet has been around long enough to be filled with what seems to be \"ancient\" data. Digging through, classifying and analyzing everything sometimes makes you feel a lot like Indiana Jones searching for the right clues in a moving puzzle. But how could you move through the caves without getting buried under piles of data rubble? How might anyone revisit and study the data from the past to transform it into actionable information for the present? In this talk we are going to show you how a threat intel Indiana Jones analyst should tackle these issues in order to find the treasure of the Threat Library. We will show you how we used the MITRE ATT&CK Framework as our book of secrets for turning dusty old Internet artifacts into a library of actionable Threat Intelligence. Recording Slide Deck Climbing the ATT&CK Ladder: How a Threat Hunting Team Has Upgraded Its Use of ATT&CK Karl Scheuerman and Piotr Wojtyla, CrowdStrike CrowdStrike\u2019s OverWatch threat hunting team has continued to mature in its use of the ATT&CK framework to categorize and track targeted adversary behavior. This presentation will build on our talk from last year\u2019s ATT&CKcon, where we shared tactic/technique trends and unique examples observed in the wild. Since that time, we have taken a number of steps to enhance our usage of ATT&CK, including: Mapping of hunting leads to ATT&CK techniques Based on that mapping, auto-tagging techniques used in any given intrusion observed in our data set For that intrusion, automatically extracting process data to easily create tables of TTP details (\u201cATT&CK Sightings\u201d) Supplementing automated ATT&CK technique tagging by human analyst reviews Leveraging MISP\u2019s API to build ATT&CK heat maps with an array of filters on demand By using practices like those outlined above, we have been able to continue building what is likely the most comprehensive and detailed library of targeted intrusion data from the wild that is mapped to ATT&CK. As such, the presentation will also share significant trends and techniques from the intrusions we\u2019ve analyzed over the past year. Recording From Susceptible to ATT&CK: A Threat Hunting Story Chris Thayer, Mastercard The story of one man's crusade to convince the Senior Management of a fortune 500 company that security resources were needed beyond the perimeter, and the role ATT&CK played in those decisions. This talk documents the creation and persuasion required to create a successful threat hunting program at an enterprise level, and how the Mitre ATT&CK framework made this possible for one investigator, in his spare time, to prove the program's worth to senior management within 1 year of creation. Recording Slide Deck ATT&CK Updates \u2013 Sightings John Wunder, MITRE Updates from the ATT&CK Team's very own John Wunder covering ATT&CK Sightings. Recording Slide Deck Zeek-based ATT&CK Metrics & Gap Analysis Allan Thomson, LookingGlass Cyber Solutions Today many organizations are using Bro (newly named Zeek) for network security monitor as it provides a powerful network analysis framework. This presentation will describe how to leverage Zeek to report on ATT&CK TTPs, raw events and other detectable activities. Key take-aways include how to report on sightings and occurrences of ATT&CK TTPs and events providing both metrics and gap analysis to inform security operations teams on where their defense may require improvement. Recording Slide Deck attckr: A Toolkit for Analysis & Visualization of ATT&CK Incident Data for Service Providers & Organizations Bob Rudis, Rapid7 The ATT&CK framework provides a standardized way for organizations to record and share attacker techniques used at each stage in attacker campaigns. Having and sharing this discrete, normalized attacker behavior is great, but these normalized bundles of incident events can also be used to identify areas of improvement in both incident response teams as well as by vendors who provide tools/solutions to triage and manage incidents. This talk will introduce {attckr}: an R package and application that provides programmatic, command-line, and interactive tools to analyze and visualize incident ATT&CK metrics. Attendees will see real-life (i.e. using real, anonymized incident data) examples of how to look across an ATT&CK incident corpus to identify trends (or outliers), support the development of ATT&CK incident baseline metrics, and develop reports and visualizations to assist in communicating operational performance, threat event frequency & type distributions for risk analysis, and identification of strengths and weaknesses in detection capability. Recording Slide Deck MITRE ATT&CK Assessment from a Data Perspective Olaf Hartong, Deloitte MITRE ATT&CK has quickly become the industry standard for referencing techniques. All though the framework is a great and valuable asset it is still lacking actionable detail on may levels to most people. I've bridged that gap by building a relatively simple assessment toolkit to visualize your potential coverage from the data already present in your environment, your mitigative measures and your detection content. The toolkit will help you focus your efforts based on your data and your goal. Recording Slide Deck Threat-Informed Defense: Where do we go from here? Richard Struse, MITRE Richard Struse explores the concept of a threat-informed defense and talks about ways of moving the cyber security community forward. Recording Slide Deck AMITT: ATT&CK-based Standards for Misinformation Threat Sharing Sara-Jayne Terp and John Gray, Credibility Coalition MisinfoSec Working Group State actors, private influence operators and grassroots groups are exploiting the openness and reach of the Internet to manipulate populations at a distance. They are extending a decades-long struggle for \u201chearts and minds\u201d via propaganda, influence operations and information warfare, often in the form of coordinated incidents that are part of longer-timescale narrative-based campaigns. The Credibility Coalition is an interdisciplinary community committed to addressing the proliferation and amplification of misinformation online, through transparent and collaborative research. Its MisinfoSec working group develops information security-based standards to promote a more formal and rigorous treatment of 1) detecting misinformation-based attacks and 2) devising methods to protect against misinformation-based attacks. Specifically, we have adapted and extended frameworks used to describe information security incidents, for use in ISACs, ISAOs and other groups sharing misinformation threats and responses. In this talk, we discuss misinformation and why stage-based frameworks like ATT&CK are appropriate for it. We describe the AMITT (Adversarial Misinformation and Influence Tactics and Techniques) misinformation response framework and its roots in and deliberate compatibility with ATT&CK, its creation, relationships with other models, its components (including ways, means, and ends to achieve influence goals) and potential uses. Recording Slide Deck Flashback with ATT&CK: Exploring Malware History with ATT&CK (2003-2018) Kris Oosthoek, Delft University of Technology Attackers keep innovating their TTPs to circumvent established defenses, so gaining insight into attacker innovation is fundamental. Our Twitter feeds are saturated with helpful reports daily, but how does this relate to trends and developments within the threat ecosystem as a whole? Take a step back, relax and get an ATT&CK-based overview of 15 years TTP evolution to inform your defense. This presentation will discuss ATT&CK techniques found in 950+ unique Windows malware families as part of an academic research project. With the malware harvested from an unbiased and reputable source, a representative view on 15 years of evolution in the malware field is ensured. For each ATT&CK tactic, the talk provides insight into trends and shifts in real-world adversary behavior. It will also highlight how a malware analysis automation pipeline can introduce biases into your CTI and based on that, best practices on how ATT&CK can be used to ensure CTI accuracy. This entertaining presentation provides practical takeaways that inform and help prioritize your threat defense. Recording Slide Deck Tell Tall Tales With ATT&CK! James Lerud, Titania Solutions Group Once upon a time there was a security expert with all kinds of ATT&CK data. There were Atomic tests, breach simulations, and metrics abound! Our hero knew he could mold the data to illustrate a story of triumph. He would deliver magnificent slides and graphs with color and shape that, even the dull c-suite would know he was great. This presentation will teach the audience how to torture ATT&CK data until it confesses. Manipulation of ordinal scales, dirty data, playing into biases, nothing is off limits if it makes us look good. Follow the advice here and you will be ready to tell tall tales with ATT&CK\u2026 or for the true hearted tell boring realistic stories. Recording Slide Deck ATT&CK Updates \u2013 ICS Otis Alexander, MITRE Updates from the ATT&CK Team's very own Otis Alexander covering ATT&CK for ICS. Recording Slide Deck Ready to ATT&CK? Bring Your Own Data (BYOD) and Validate Your Data Analytics! Roberto Rodriguez, Cybersecurity Specialist; Jose Luis Rodriguez, Student \"How do we collect the right data for the detection of specific adversarial techniques?\" That is a very important and common question for organizations planning on leveraging ATT&CK for their defensive strategy. One approach might be reading the data sources metadata available per each technique in the ATT&CK framework. That is a good first step, and it is already helping organizations to integrate the framework with their current security controls. However, as you go deeper into the specific recommended data sources per technique, it is very important to understand that not every technique variation requires the same data sources. In addition, there needs to be a way to validate if what we are collecting aligns with the data analytics being created. In this talk, we will share our current experiences contributing to the \"Data Sources\" section of ATT&CK framework and the Cyber Analytics Repository (CAR) project. We will show how to use pre-captured datasets from our open source project named Mordor to expedite simulation of adversarial techniques and validation of data analytics. In addition, we will show how we leverage Jupyter Notebooks to develop and test data analytics from projects like CAR to finish the validation process and provide recommendations. Recording Slide Deck Prioritizing Data Sources for Minimum Viable Detection Keith McCammon, Red Canary MITRE ATT&CK\u00ae is more than a glossary of security terminology that offers us a common language to communicate about threats. While each technique includes a description, it also includes a list of the requisite data sources necessary to observe an adversary leveraging that technique\u2014transforming ATT&CK from a nebulous collection of definitions into a practical tool for improving detection coverage. However, in the same way that you can\u2019t simply build alerts for every technique, you can\u2019t gain access to every data source. How do you effectively prioritize data sources so that you are getting the best returns on your visibility investments? Recording Slide Deck ATT&CK Updates \u2013 Controls Mapping Mike Long, MITRE Updates from the ATT&CK Team's very own Mike Long covering controls mapping. Recording Slide Deck The World\u2019s Most Dangerous ATT&CKers Robert Lipovsk\u00fd, ESET As a research-oriented cybersecurity company that regularly discloses detailed analyses of cyberattacks to clients and/or the public, the introduction of MITRE ATT&CK as a common language to describe adversary techniques and tactics was certainly welcome. We\u2019ll begin our presentation by introducing exactly how and why we started using ATT&CK, providing examples of mappings in our research publications, as well as the role it plays in enhancing our EDR solutions. We\u2019ll also describe our experience with contributing to the ATT&CK knowledge base. The main part of the talk will be example-driven. Having played a key role in analyzing some of the most significant cyberattacks in history, we\u2019ll go over the most interesting tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the adversaries, mapping them to ATT&CK. Specifically, we\u2019ll analyze the TTPs of Sednit (a.k.a. APT28), the group reportedly responsible for the Democratic National Committee hack that affected the US 2016 elections, and Telebots (a.k.a. Sandworm), the group behind the first malware-driven electricity blackouts (BlackEnergy and Industroyer) and, the most damaging cyberattack ever (NotPetya). Finally, we\u2019ll conclude with our analysis of the current threat landscape and trends, and highlight how we anticipate it will shape ATT&CK going forward. Recording Slide Deck Lessons in Purple Teaming with ATT&CK Daniel Wyleczuk-Stern, Praetorian; Matt Southworth, Priceline, Booking Holdings For the past year, Praetorian and Priceline have been working together to conduct a series of Purple Team exercises to improve Priceline\u2019s Detection and Response. These exercises utilized tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) from the MITRE ATT&CK framework to baseline Priceline\u2019s telemetry and analysis capabilities. Praetorian leveraged their recently released Metasploit Framework fork to rapidly automate basic TTPs before working cooperatively with Priceline for more advanced tests. Priceline then did the heavy lift of ingesting that data, prioritizing shortcomings, and making strategic and tactical decisions to improve their security program. Through the use of ATT&CK, they were able to trace specific lines of effort back to various TTPs. This traceability helped provide support for various decisions as well as facilitated with prioritization. ATT&CK also provided a common taxonomy when working with vendors when gaps in detection were identified. Finally, ATT&CK helped Priceline track improvements through later rounds of testing to help measure the effectiveness of various improvements.

Recording Slide Deck Lightning Talk: A Love Song for Heat Maps Brian Donohue, Red Canary How do you decide where to allocate your security resources and budget? Maybe you've got seasoned security professionals making decisions based on experience and intuition, maybe your decisions are driven by insurance or compliance requirements, or maybe they're completely arbitrary. Whatever the case, we can all associate ATT&CK techniques and data sources with the events we prevent, detect, or respond to. This talk will explore how security professionals can turn their internal security data into community intelligence that enumerates the threats that occur most often, enabling us all to establish data-based priorities that guide the way we spend our money and time\u2014whether we\u2019re buying, developing, or selling security tools. Recording Lightning Talk: Operationalize ATT&CK with Boring Dashboards Dan Cole, ThreatConnect Inc Vendors often showcase dashboards with 3D rotating globes, animated bar graphs, and enough colors to fill a Crayola 64 pack. In this talk, I'll show how a simple dashboard of dull, boring, non-flashy, inanimate DATATABLES can be used (along with ATT&CK and a decent intel requirements process) to help analysts stay focused. Recording Lightning Talk: MITRE ATT&CK Maturity Model Mappings from In the Field Observations Stephan Chenette, AttackIQ In this lightning talk, I'll present in the field observations of what elements of ATT&CK organizations can put into action at each maturity level of their security program to start or continue to incorporate and operationalize the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Recording Lightning Talk: ATT&CK Poker Ivan Ninichuck, Cyber Knights My talk will be a 5 minute introduction to the concept of applying game theory to our use of Att&ck in predicting adversary actions. I am currently designing a poker style card game along these principles and would like to show off what I have so far. Recording Slide Deck Lightning Talk: Tracking and measuring your ATT&CK coverage with ATT&CK2Jira Mauricio Velazco Tracking and measuring coverage against the ATT&CK framework can be a challenging task. This lighting talk will introduce Att&ck2Jira, a tool that leverages Jira and the Att&ck navigator that can help blue teams automate this effort. No more spreadsheets! Recording Slide Deck Lightning Talk: STIX in the Mud Bryson Bort, SCYTHE CTI today = static solutions of yesterday. STIX currently adequately supports today\u2019s requirements. What is if we could operationalize attacks (ATT&CK) with it? Recording Slide Deck Lightning Talk: ATT&CK, Intelligence, and Micro-Purple Teaming Emma MacMullan, Federal Reserve Intel-driven Purple Teaming can enhance simulated attacks by using ATT&CK to create real-time tactical information on current threat actor behaviors, as well as validate existing detections and identify gaps in coverage. This lightning talk will be a snapshot into an ad-hoc side project that showed you don\u2019t need a big report or a lot of man hours to ask some interesting questions; you just need a little spontaneity, a single TTP, and of course, ATT&CK. Recording Lightning Talk: #GuardrailsoftheGalaxy: The Prologue Nick Carr, FireEye Providing a quick survey of execution guardrails, environmental keying, and announcing the 2019 nominees for best in-the-wild adversary use of guardrailing.

Recording Slide Deck State of the ATT&CK Adam Pennington, MITRE ATT&CK Recording Slide Deck Mapping to MITRE ATT&CK: Enhancing Operations Through the Tracking of Interactive Intrusion Campaigns.pdf Jason Wood, Justin Swisher, CrowdStrike When it comes to understanding and tracking intrusion tradecraft, security teams must have the tools and processes that allow the mapping of hands-on adversary tradecraft. Doing this enables your team to both understand the adversaries and attacks you currently see and observe how these adversaries and attacks evolve over time. This session will explore how a threat hunting team uses MITRE ATT&CK to understand and categorize adversary activity. The team will demonstrate how threat hunters map ATT&CK TTPs by showcasing a recent interactive intrusion against a Linux endpoint and how the framework allowed for granular tracking of tradecraft and enhanced security operations. They will also take a look into the changes in the Linux activity they have observed over time, using the ATT&CK navigator to compare and contrast technique usage. This session will provide insights into how we use MITRE ATT&CK as a powerful resource to track intrusion tradecraft, identify adversary trends, and prepare for attacks of the future. Recording Slide Deck Knowledge for the masses: Storytelling with ATT&CK Ismael Valenzuela, Jose Luis Sanchez Martinez, Trellix The Trellix team believes that creating and sharing compelling stories about cyber threats -with ATT&CK- is a powerful way for raising awareness and enabling actionability against cyber threats.In this talk the team will share their experiences leveraging ATT&CK to disseminate Threat knowledge to different audiences (Software Development teams, Managers, Threat detection engineers, Threat hunters, Cyber Threat Analysts, Support Engineers, upper management, etc.).They will show concrete examples and representations created with ATT&CK to describe the threats at different levels, including: 1) an Attack Path graph that shows the overall flow of the attack; 2) Tactic-specific TTP summary tables and graphs; 3) very detailed, step-by-step description of the attacker's behaviors. Recording Slide Deck Tracking Noisy Behavior and Risk-Based Alerting with ATT&CK Haylee Mills, Splunk Having ATT&CK to identify threats, prioritize data sources, and improve security posture has been a huge step forward for our industry, but how do we actualize those insights for better detection and alerting? By shifting to observations of behavior over one-to-one direct alerts, noisy datasets become valuable treasure troves with ATT&CK metadata. Additionally, we can begin to look at detection and threat hunting on behavior instead of users or systems. In this presentation, Haylee will discuss the shift in mindset and the nuts and bolts of detections that leverage this metadata in Splunk, but the concept can be applied with custom tools to any valuable security dataset. Recording Slide Deck ATT&CK Updates- Defensive ATT&CK Lex Crumpton, MITRE ATT&CK Recording Slide Deck Would you Rather Have Telemetry into 2 Attacks or 20? An Insight Into Highly Valued Data Sources Jonny Johnson, Olaf Hartong, Red Canary and FalconForce As defenders, we often find ourselves wanting \"more\" data. But why? Will this new data provide a lot of value or is it for a very niche circumstance? How many attacks does it apply to? Are we leveraging previous data sources to their full capability? Within this talk, Olaf and Jonny will walk through different data sources they leverage more than most when analyzing data within environments, why they do, and what these data sources do and can provide in terms of value to a defender. Recording Slide Deck ATT&CK Metaverse - Exploring the Limitations of Applying ATT&CK Gert-Jan Bruggink, Venation Since it's inception in 2015, the ATT&CK framework has achieved widespread adoption, with recent studies suggesting over 80 percent of companies using the framework for cyber security. Over the last seven years, a variety of use cases has been explored with different measures of success. In this presentation, Gert-Jan will explore applying the ATT&CK framework in scenario-based defense. When adopting a scenario approach, security teams collaborate to fuse their understanding of certain situations into scenarios. For example, addressing different hypotheses that can be explained to leadership and specialist teams alike. This approach requires more than \"just\" breaking down everything into tactics, techniques, and procedures. Some stakeholders might not understand that. For example, some might want to tell a good story about adversaries while others want to translate their understanding of intrusions into a sequential pattern. The objective of this talk is to explore how the granularity of the framework supports creation of scenarios, the limitations in the current approach to ATT&CK when building scenarios across different stakeholders, and addressing potential areas the \"language of ATT&CK\" can evolve towards over the next 5 years. Recording Slide Deck It's just a jump to the left (of boom): Prioritizing detection implementation with intelligence and ATT&CK Lindsay Kaye, Scott Small, Recorded Future Many organizations ask: \"Where do I start, and where do I go next\" when prioritizing implementation of behavior-based detections? We often hear \"use threat intelligence!\" but your goals must be qualified and quantified in order to properly prioritize the most relevant TTPs. A wealth of open-sourced, ATT&CK-mapped resources now exists, giving security teams greater access to both detections and red team tests they can implement, but intelligence (also aligned with ATT&CK), is essential to provide necessary context to ensure that detection efforts are focused effectively.This session will discuss a new approach to the prioritization challenge, starting with an analysis of the current defensive landscape, as measured by ATT&CK coverage for more than a dozen detection repositories and technologies, and guidance on sourcing TTP intelligence. The team will then show how real-world defensive strategies can be strengthened by encompassing a full-spectrum view of threat detection, including the implementation of YARA, Sigma, and Snort in security appliances. Critically, alignment of both intelligence and defenses with ATT&CK enables defenders to move the focus of detection efforts to indications of malicious behavior before the final payload is deployed, where controls are most effective at preventing serious damage to the organization. Recording Slide Deck ATT&CK Updates- Campaigns Matt Malone, MITRE ATT&CK Recording Slide Deck Landing on Jupyter: The transformative power of data-driven storytelling for security operations Jose Barajas, Stephan Chenette, AttackIQ Every cybersecurity leader wants visibility into the health of their security program. Yet teams suffer with disparate data streams - CTI teams and the SOC often use separate Excel spreadsheets, an anachronistic practice - and silos constrain their ability to operate effectively. Enter the Jupyter notebook, an open-source computational notebook that researchers use to combine code, computing output, text, and media into a single interface. In this talk, we share three stories of how organizations use Jupyter notebooks to align ATT&CK-based attack flows to the security program, generating data about detection and prevention failures, defensive gaps, and longitudinal performance. By using Jupyter notebooks in this way, teams can better leverage ATT&CK for security effectiveness. It becomes less of a bingo card and more of a strategic tool for understanding the health of the program against big tactics (I.e., lateral movement), defensive gaps (I.e., micro-segmentation), and the team's performance. Recording Slide Deck The ATT&CK Philharmonic Ivan Ninichuck, Andy Shepard, Siemplify The MITRE ATT&CK framework has improved many areas within the infosec workflow. But many of these select areas are those that are relatively isolated from the tactical operations faced every day by lower or mid-tier analysts. When faced with alert fatigue and an ever-growing number of data sources, the impact of ATT&CK can become esoteric to non-existent. In this presentation experts from Siemplify propose the problem be looked at like an orchestra with its dozens of instrument types. Without a conductor to guide each section there would only be noise, but with the conductor leading, beautiful symphonies can now be played. The Siemplify team plan to show how a SOAR platform can be that conductor using the ATT&CK framework as its sheet music, and turn the constant noise into a threat intel driven security program. Recording Slide Deck Automating the mundanity of technique IDs with ATT&CK Detections Collector Marcus LaFerrera, Ryan Kovar, Splunk Since the release of MITRE ATT&CK, vendors and governmental bodies have begun mapping their security blogs, whitepapers, and threat intel reports to ATT&CK TTPs, which is incredible! Vendors have then begun mapping their detections to those mapped TTPs, which is even more awesome! What is not awesome is dissecting a piece of prose for all of the specific embedded ATT&CK technique IDs and then mapping them to your detections to determine coverage. Over the last year, the team at Splunk has spent more time doing this than they would like to admit, so they wrote a tool to do it for them and want to share it with the world. Join the Splunk team as they tell the world about ATT&CK Detections Collector (ADC). ADC is an open-source python tool that will allow you to extract MITRE technique IDs from a third-party URLs and output them into a file. If you use Splunk, the team even maps them to their existing (previously mapped) detection corpus. They even added the ability to export them into a navigator json for fun, profit, or (at least) better visualization! Recording Slide Deck The ATT&CK Latin American APT Playbook Santiago Pontiroli, Dmitry Bestuzhev, Kaspersky Financially motivated cyber-attacks thrive in emerging Latin American markets. However, there's room for locally grown threat actors operating in the cyber espionage field as well. During the last decade, this includes but is not limited to Blind Eagle, Puppeteer, Machete, Poseidon, and others. We also saw foreign operations targeting specific assets in Latin America, still connected to certain regional sources.Since the threat actors' origin, culture, and language is often different, it's not uncommon for tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to present marked differences. As a result of our regional expertise and experience, we created MITRE's ATT&CK play-by-play mappings to help other analysts understand regional actors. If you are interested in threat intelligence and what's going on in Latin America, this presentation is for you. Our work is based only on real-world attackers and their operations, including those not publicly known, such as COVID-19 Machete's targeted campaign. Recording Slide Deck Mapping ATT&CK Techniques to ENGAGE Activities David Barroso, CounterCraft When an adversary engages in a specific behavior, they are vulnerable to expose an unintended weakness. By looking at each ATT&CK technique, we can examine the weaknesses revealed and identify an engagement activity or activities to exploit this weakness.During the presentation we will see some real examples of how we can use different ATT&CK techniques in order to plan different adversary engagement activities. Recording Slide Deck When Insiders ATT&CK! Matt Snyder, VMWare Insider threats are some of the most treacherous and every organization is susceptible: it's estimated that theft of Intellectual Property alone exceeds $600 billion a year. Armed with intimate knowledge of your organization and masked as legitimate business, often these attacks go unnoticed until it's too late and the damage is done. To make matters worse, threat actors are now trying to lure employees with the promise of large paydays to help carry out attacks. These advanced attacks require advanced solutions, and we are going to demonstrate how we are using the MITRE ATT&CK framework to proactively combat these threats. Armed with these tactics and techniques, we show you how to build intelligent detections to help secure even the toughest of environments. Recording Slide Deck ATT&CK Updates- ATT&CK for ICS Otis Alexander, MITRE ATT&CK Recording Slide Deck Exploring how Students Map Social Engineering Techniques to the ATT&CK Framework During a Real-Time Cybersecurity Exercise Aunshul Rege, Katorah Williams Social engineering (SE) is a technique used by cybercriminals to psychologically manipulate individuals into disclosing sensitive information and providing unauthorized access. Penetration testers are tasked with simulating targeted attacks on a company's system to determine any weaknesses in their environment. The 2021 Summer SE Pen Test Competition allowed students to experience SE pen testing in a safe and ethical way. Student teams were \"hired\" to conduct a SE pen test on the CARE Lab (run by the authors) and their employees (the authors themselves)! Teams had to use OSINT, phishing, and vishing in real-time to target the lab, develop attack playbooks, and map the techniques to the ATT&CK framework. This talk shares the application of ATT&CK in cybersecurity education. Specifically, it (i) focuses on how students map their SE attack playbooks to the ATT&CK framework, (ii) compares/contrasts SE techniques across various student groups: 6 graduate teams, 9 undergraduate teams, and 1 high school team, and (iii) how ATT&CK can be used for SE. Recording Slide Deck ATT&CKing the Red/Blue Divide Fred Frey, Jonathan Mulholland, SnapAttack Atomic Red Team and Sigma are the largest open-source attack simulation and analytic projects. Many organizations utilize one or both internally for security controls validation or supplementing their detections and alerts. Building on the work from these two great communities, we smashed (scientific-term) the attacks and analytics together and applied data science to analyze the results. We'll describe our methodology and testing framework, show the real-world MITRE ATT&CK coverage and gaps, discuss our algorithms for calculating analytic similarity, identifying log sources for a technique, and determining the best analytics to deploy that maximizes ATT&CK coverage. This project aims to: - Bring a measurable testing rigor to community analytics to improve adoption - Test every analytic against every attack, validating the true positive detection - Understand the log sources required to detect specific attack techniques - Apply data science to identify analytic similarity (reduce community duplication) - Identify gaps between the projects' analytics without attack simulations; attack simulations without detections; missing or incorrect MITRE ATT&CK labels, etc - Automate the process so insights can stay up to date with new attack/analytic contributions over time - Share our analysis back to the community to improve these projects Recording Slide Deck ATT&CK Updates- ATT&CK for mac/Linux Cat Self, MITRE ATT&CK Recording Slide Deck What is ATT&CK coverage, anyway? Breadth and depth analysis with Atomic Red Team Brian Donohue, Red Canary This presentation will highlight the Atomic Red Team project's efforts to define and increase the test coverage of MITRE ATT&CK techniques. We'll describe the challenges we encountered in defining what \"coverage\" means in the context of an ATT&CK-based framework, and how to use that definition to improve an open source project that's used by a diverse audience of practitioners to satisfy an equally diverse array of needs. The audience will learn how the Atomic Red Team maintainers standardize and categorize atomic tests, perform gap analysis to achieve deep technique-level coverage and broad matrix-level coverage, and quickly fill those gaps with new tests. Recording Slide Deck ATT&CKING Containers in The Cloud Jared Stroud, Lacework Adversaries target common cloud misconfigurations in container-focused workflows for initial access. Whether this is Docker or Kubernetes environments, Lacework Labs has identified adversaries attempting to deploy malicious container images (T1610) , mine Cryptocurrency (T1496), and deploy C2 agents. Defenders new to the container space may be unaware of the built-in capabilities popular container runtime engines have that can help defend against rogue containers being deployed into their environment. Attendees will walk away with an understanding of what these attack patterns look like based on honeypot data Lacework has gathered over the past year, as well as techniques on how to defend their own container focused workloads. Recording Slide Deck Threat Modelling - It's not just for developers Tim Wadhwa-Brown, Cisco The purpose of this session will be to look at how you can take public information about threat actors, vulnerabilities, and incidents and use them to build better defenses, utilizing ATT&CK along the way to align your security organization to the people and assets that matter.Stories are critical to how humans learn, so this session will leverage a story book approach to give the audience some ideas on approaches they could use. Tim will take the audience through 3 real world examples where he has leveraged ATT&CK to drive operational improvement. The premise of each story will be real, although some of the details will be apocryphal to protect the innocent.One story will focus on defending a network, one will look at adversary detection, while the final one will look at responding to an active attack and in each case, Tim will guide the audience to think about the kinds of data sources that ATT&CK tracks, that they might call upon to achieve a successful outcome.

"content": " Adversary Emulation Plans To showcase the practical use of ATT&CK for offensive operators and defenders, MITRE created Adversary Emulation Plans. These are prototype documents of what can be done with publicly available threat reports and ATT&CK. The purpose of this activity is to allow defenders to more effectively test their networks and defenses by enabling red teams to more actively model adversary behavior, as described by ATT&CK. This is part of a larger process to help more effectively test products and environments, as well as create analytics for ATT&CK behaviors rather than detecting a specific indicator of compromise (IOC) or specific tool. There are many threat intel reports that focus on malware reverse engineering, initial compromise, and command and control (C2) explanations; however, there are not many threat reports on how attackers are chaining techniques together or how attackers operate on keyboard. Because these prototypes are built on these open threat reports, they have the same limitations. To help with this, we provided a sample way to string the ATT&CK tactics together based on general red teaming experience. To create these plans, the team drilled down on specific APT groups listed in ATT&CK and see what kind of plans could be generated for an operator to emulate those APTs. After reading what capabilities were provided by an APT's tools, we compiled a list of other ways to exhibit the same behavior. We wanted operators to behave generally like a specific adversary (sticking to that adversary's known TTPs and behaviors), but having some latitude in actual implementation. To help with this, we also provided a cheat sheet for commands that can be executed for similar behavior in some of the most commonly used red teaming tools. An example, high-level diagram below highlights one possible way to structure an APT3 emulation plan. We will not be going through this for every group on ATT&CK, rather select a subset we feel offer a unique perspective for defenses to be measured. We hope that the community finds use in these prototypes, and builds on them to make ATT&CK actionable. These are living documents that can be updated with newer information, format, or changed for other uses. Please reach out to attack@mitre.org for anything relating to these prototypes. Emulation Plan Documents APT3 The MITRE APT3 Adversary Emulation Plans outline the behavior of persistent threat groups mapped to ATT&CK. They are used by adversary emulation teams to test an organizations network security and security products against specific threats. APT3 Adversary Emulation Plan The Adversary Emulation Field Manual is a companion document to the Adversary Emulation Plan for a particular adversary group. It breaks out command-by-command actions that the group is known to use or example commands to exhibit the same behavior as their tools, mapped to ATT&CK and related commands from public and commercially available offensive testing frameworks.

ATT&CK Navigator The ATT&CK Navigator is a web-based tool for annotating and exploring ATT&CK matrices. It can be used to visualize defensive coverage, red/blue team planning, the frequency of detected techniques, and more. Visit Repository Open Application ATT&CK Workbench The ATT&CK Workbench is an application allowing users to explore, create, annotate, and share extensions of the ATT&CK knowledge base. Visit Repository Python Utilities ATT&CK provides a variety of Python tools for accessing, querying, and processing the ATT&CK dataset. These scripts can be useful utilities or serve as examples for how to work with ATT&CK programmatically. Visit Repository Accessing ATT&CK Data ATT&CK in STIX Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX\u2122) is a language and serialization format used to exchange cyber threat intelligence (CTI). The ATT&CK dataset is available in STIX 2.0 and STIX 2.1. Other presentations of this dataset, including the ATT&CK Navigator and this website, are built from the STIX data. STIX is a machine-readable format providing access to the ATT&CK knowledge base. It is the most granular representation of the ATT&CK data, and all other representations are derived from the STIX dataset. The ATT&CK STIX representation is most easily manipulated in Python using the stix2 library. However, because STIX is represented in JSON, other programming languages can easily interact with the raw content. Consider using ATT&CK in STIX if you: Have automated workflows that need to ingest ATT&CK data. Are a proficient Python user seeking to save time with automation or want to perform advanced queries. Want your workflows to keep up-to-date with the evolving knowledge base. Want to extend the ATT&CK dataset with custom content, and use this custom content with ATT&CK tools. ATT&CK in STIX 2.1 Visit Repository ATT&CK in STIX 2.0 Visit Repository Learn more about STIX TAXII 2.1 The ATT&CK STIX data can also be accessed via the official ATT&CK TAXII\u2122 server. Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII) is an application protocol for exchanging CTI over HTTPS. The ATT&CK TAXII server provides API access to the ATT&CK STIX knowledge base. Visit Repository Learn more about TAXII ATT&CK Data Model The ATT&CK Data Model provides a standardized way to represent ATT&CK data using Zod schemas. It enables developers to parse, validate, and utilize the ATT&CK knowledge base efficiently in various formats. Visit Repository Learn more about the ATT&CK Data Model ATT&CK in Excel These spreadsheets are built from the STIX dataset and provide a more human-accessible view into the knowledge base while also supporting rudimentary querying/filtering capabilities. The Excel representation of the ATT&CK dataset below includes both master spreadsheets, containing all object types, and individual spreadsheets for each object type. The individual type spreadsheets break out relationships (e.g procedure examples connecting groups to techniques) into separate sheets by relationship type, while the master spreadsheet includes all relationship types in a single sheet. A citations sheet can be used to look up the in-text citations which appear in some fields. For domains that include multiple matrices, such as Mobile ATT&CK, each matrix gets its own named sheet. Unlike the STIX dataset, objects that have been revoked or deprecated are not included in the spreadsheets. Consider using ATT&CK in Excel if you: Want to quickly sort, filter and query the dataset in a familiar UI. Want to explore the contents of the dataset without having to navigate around the ATT&CK website. Are not comfortable enough in Python or other programming languages to work with the STIX representation.

"content": " Contribute ATT&CK is in a constant state of development. We are always on the lookout for new information to help refine and extend what is covered. If you have additional techniques, know about variations on one already covered, have examples of techniques in use, or have other relevant information, then we would like to hear from you. We are looking for contributions in the following areas, but all contributions and feedback to ATT&CK are appreciated. If you have other information you think may be useful, please reach us at attack@mitre.org. Due to the high volume of contributions, it may take us about a week to get back to you. We recommend you read our philosophy paper to understand our approach to maintaining ATT&CK so that we get the right details up front. Content updates happen roughly every 6 months. Submit a contribution What we're looking for Sub-Techniques and Techniques Let us know what new variations of behaviors real adversaries are using in the wild! Please share a brief description of the behavior, any references or knowledge about how it works and was used, and how this behavior is not already captured in ATT&CK.To understand the process of how the MITRE team develops techniques, refer to the video below. See an example Video Threat Intelligence We map Group and Software examples on our site, and appreciate your help with referenced information about how Groups and Software samples use ATT&CK techniques. Please share the sub-technique or technique name, group or associated group name, a brief description of how the technique is implemented, and the publicly-available reference. See an example Website Content Errors If you find errors or typos on the site related to content, please let us know by submitting the url where you found the error and a short description. Examples include typos and syntax errors, improperly formatted web pages, and 404 errors when links are clicked. See an example New Technique Example \u00d7 (Sub-)Technique Name: COM, ROM, & BE GONE Tactic: Persistence Platform: Windows Required Permissions: User Sub-techniques: This is a sub-technique of T1XXX, or this would have T1XXX as a sub-technique Data Sources: Windows API, Process monitoring, or other sources that can be used to detect this activity Description: Component Object Model (COM) servers associated with Graphics Interchange Format (JIF) image viewers can be abused to corrupt arbitrary memory banks. Adversaries may leverage this opportunity to modify, mux, and maliciously annoy (MMA) read-only memory (ROM) regularly accessed during normal system operations. Detection: Monitor the JIF viewers for muxing and malicious annoyance. Use event ID 423420 and 234222 to detect changes. Mitigation: Configure the Registry key HKLM\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet\\001\\Control\\WindowsJIFControl\\ to 0 to disable MMA access if not needed within the environment. Adversary Use: Here is a publicly-available reference about FUZZYSNUGGLYDUCK using this technique: (www[.]awesomeThreatReports[.]org/FUZZYSNUGGLYDUCK_NOMS _ON_ROM_VIA_COM).

"content": " ATT&CK Sightings The ATT&CK Team believes that we can best equip teams to defend against adversaries by collecting and reporting sightings of techniques to the entire community, so we're conducting a pilot to solicit that data. You can share to help make the whole community better! Background Though the open-source reporting that is integrated into ATT&CK provides important information about which techniques are used by which adversaries, it is subject to various biases: Novelty bias: new and interesting techniques or existing techniques used by new actors get reported, while run of the mill techniques used over and over again do not. Visibility bias: organizations publishing intel reports have visibility of certain techniques and not others. For incident responders, responding to a fire in progress vice sifting through the ashes to find out what happened will give a different view as well. Not all techniques can be viewed the same way during or after an incident. Producer bias: some organizations publish much more reporting, and the types of customers or visibility they have may not reflect the broader industry/world. Victim bias: certain types of victim organizations may be more likely to report (or be reported on) than others. Availability bias: techniques that are easily called to mind are likely reported more frequently, as report authors think to include them more often. This doesn't mean that information contained in threat reports is useless -- obviously, it's very useful towards telling us what's being used, by who, and how. It\u2019s the entire foundation of the ATT&CK knowledge base. But, what it does mean is that using it as raw data to understand the prevalence of techniques or how they\u2019re leveraged over time and across industries might give deceiving answers. This can be particularly important if you\u2019re prioritizing defensive operations \u2013 you want to focus defenses on techniques that are used more often by more adversaries, not just those that are new and interesting or come to mind more easily. To help counter this and extend ATT&CK\u2019s foundation as a data-driven knowledge base, the team will begin soliciting contributions of raw sightings of ATT&CK techniques. We hope that this data will help us make the ATT&CK knowledge base itself better as well as make it easier for consumers to understand how techniques are used. Types of Sightings ATT&CK sightings data collection will take three forms, each of which provides a different insight into the usage of techniques. Direct sighting of a technique The ATT&CK team is most interested in data from actual sightings of techniques being executed in the course of an attack. In other words, during an event investigation data is collected which shows that one or more ATT&CK techniques were actually used by the adversary on (or targeted at) the victim infrastructure. Cases where multiple techniques were detected as part of a single attack should be reported as a single sighting with multiple techniques listed. Example: If mimikatz were used on a victim machine to dump credentials and that was observed by an EDR tool, it would constitute a direct sighting of Credential Dumping. This might take the form of a sighting of a process accessing lsass.exe memory, for example. Direct sightings of techniques are the most valuable type of sighting because they tell you, at a ground-truth level, that the adversary relied on a specific technique to carry out an attack. Direct technique sightings are reported using the direct-technique-sighting format. Direct sighting of malicious software In some cases, a technique might not be directly observed (or even be observable given sensing capability) but the presence of a piece of malicious software on the machine can give a strong hint that it was used. In other cases, software to carry out a technique might be blocked at the perimeter \u2013 in those cases, it indicates that the adversary might have wanted to use a certain technique but wasn't able to. Note: There is of course a grey area when talking about malicious software. What we mean is tools that can be used to carry out malicious attacks, including things commonly called \"penetration test\" software as well as those that are clearly malicious. On the other hand, we don't mean built-in OS functionality. So please do send us sightings of things like metasploit or cobalt strike, but do not send us sightings of powershell or the net command. Those latter items should be reported as a direct sighting of a technique (e.g., T1086). Example: The presence of mimikatz.exe on a machine without evidence that it was actually run to dump credentials \u2013 or, mimikatz.exe being blocked at the perimeter or by antimalware -- would constitute a direct sighting of mimikatz. From that, you can assume some attempt to perform credential access techniques available in mimikatz -- but because they were not directly observed, you can't be certain exactly what did or could have happened. Note that direct software sightings are most useful for software already contained in ATT&CK that directly enables one or more ATT&CK techniques. Direct software sightings are reported using the direct-software-sighting format. Indirect sightings of malicious software In other cases, threat intelligence platforms or ISACs might have data feeds that indirectly demonstrate the fact that a piece of software is being used, without directly observing it. Example: A file hash for mimikatz.exe shared to an ISAC or threat intel platform would be an indirect sighting of mimikatz.exe. As with a direct sighting of malware, this does provide some indication (though weaker) that an adversary was interested in performing credential access. Note that, as above, indirect software sightings are most useful for software already contained in ATT&CK that directly enables one or more ATT&CK techniques. Additionally, indirect sightings should only be reported when there is a reasonable presumption that they haven't been reported by another party. In other words, don't write a scraper for some TIP and send sightings for all IOCs in that TIP unless you own or operate the TIP (if you do, please send us the sightings!). Indirect software sightings are reported using the indirect-software-sighting format. Data Usage In general, the ATT&CK team believes that richer data collection of more raw data will allow us to better understand how techniques are used in practice. You could ask questions like: Which techniques are used more often? Do the techniques used differ by sector? Do the techniques used differ by actor type (APT vs. FIN)? How does usage change over time? Though the eventual goal of this program is to provide useful data to the community, in order to tread carefully, at this initial piloting stage we would keep the data internal to the MITRE ATT&CK team and would protect it by an NDA. The goals of this would be to: Prove the concept works and that quality data can be collected Understand the differences between the types of data that are contributed, and how they can still be aggregated to provide a consistent picture Work with submitters to identify how they want data to eventually be published (i.e., how it\u2019s attributed, how data from different submitters is combined, how much it has to be aggregated, etc.) Iron out any kinks in the collection process (our data format, etc.) After those initial steps are completed (we expect a few months, but it could be longer) and the participants can agree on how they want the data published we\u2019ll begin initial operations. At that phase, we\u2019ll continue to work closely with all submitters to ensure that we get the data we\u2019re expecting. Over time, we can transition to more automated collection and processing. Note that this is not an operational threat sharing mechanism and we do not intend to ever directly share even anonymized raw sightings data. Contribute Have data that fits into one of these buckets? Contact us at attack@mitre.org to get started! In particular we hope that EDR vendors, intel reporters, TIP vendors, ISACs, and end user organizations can help the community by providing this data.

"content": " Updates - October 2025 Version Start Date End Date Data Changelogs ATT&CK v18 October 28, 2025 Current version of ATT&CK v18.0 on MITRE/CTI 17.1 - 18.0 Details (JSON) The October 2025 (v18) ATT&CK release updates Techniques, Groups, Campaigns and Software for Enterprise, Mobile, and ICS. The biggest changes in ATT&CK are related to the defensive portion of the framework. Detections in techniques have been replaced with Detection Strategies resulting in the addition of Detection Strategies and Analytics, major updates to Data Components, as well as the deprecation of Data Sources. ATT&CK's STIX representation, including these new objects, is described in detail in ATT&CK Data Model. A post describing the defensive changes to the ATT&CK website and the rationalle behind them was published to ATT&CK's Blog in July 2025, and an accompanying blog post describes changes across the release. In this release the Mobile Technique Abuse Accessibility Features has been un-deprecated (last seen in ATT&CK v6). This release also includes a human-readable detailed changelog showing more specifically what changed in updated ATT&CK objects, and a machine-readable JSON changelog, whose format is described in ATT&CK's Github. Statistics This version of ATT&CK contains 910 Software, 176 Groups, and 55 Campaigns. Broken out by domain: Enterprise: 14 Tactics, 216 Techniques, 475 Sub-Techniques, 172 Groups, 784 Software, 52 Campaigns, 44 Mitigations, 691 Detection Strategies, 1739 Analytics, and 106 Data Components Mobile: 12 Tactics, 77 Techniques, 47 Sub-Techniques, 17 Groups, 122 Software, 3 Campaigns, 13 Mitigations, 124 Detection Strategies, 211 Analytics, and 17 Data Components ICS: 12 Tactics, 83 Techniques, 14 Groups, 23 Software, 7 Campaigns, 52 Mitigations, 18 Assets, 83 Detection Strategies, 82 Analytics, and 36 Data Components Release Notes Terminology New objects: ATT&CK objects which are only present in the new release. Major version changes: ATT&CK objects that have a major version change. (e.g. 1.0 \u2192 2.0) Minor version changes: ATT&CK objects that have a minor version change. (e.g. 1.0 \u2192 1.1) Other version changes: ATT&CK objects that have a version change of any other kind. (e.g. 1.0 \u2192 1.2) Patches: ATT&CK objects that have been patched while keeping the version the same. (e.g., 1.0 \u2192 1.0 but something like a typo, a URL, or some metadata was fixed) Object revocations: ATT&CK objects which are revoked by a different object. Object deprecations: ATT&CK objects which are deprecated and no longer in use, and not replaced. Object deletions: ATT&CK objects which are no longer found in the STIX data.

"content": " Updates - April 2025 Version Start Date End Date Data Changelogs ATT&CK v17 April 22, 2025 October 27, 2025 v17.0 on MITRE/CTI v17.1 on MITRE/CTI 16.1 - 17.0 Details (JSON) 17.0 - 17.1 Details (JSON) The April 2025 (v17) ATT&CK release updates Techniques, Groups, Campaigns and Software for Enterprise, Mobile, and ICS. The biggest changes in ATT&CK v17 are the addition of an ESXi platform to ATT&CK's Enterprise domain describing adversary activity taking place on the VMWare ESXi hypervisor, a dramatic improvement of Enterprise Mitigation descriptions, and the renaming of the Network platform to Network Devices in order to more clearly communicate the scope of the platform. An accompanying blog post describes these changes as well as additional improvements across ATT&CK's various domains and platforms. In this release we have revoked Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading and merged it into Hijack Execution Flow: DLL, which itself was renamed from Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Search Order Hijacking. This change was made to reflect the previously overlapping scope of the two sub-techniques and frequent confusion between them. This release also includes a human-readable detailed changelog showing more specifically what changed in updated ATT&CK objects, and a machine-readable JSON changelog, whose format is described in ATT&CK's Github. This version of ATT&CK contains 877 Pieces of Software, 170 Groups, and 50 Campaigns Broken out by domain: Enterprise: 14 Tactics, 211 Techniques, 468 Sub-Techniques, 166 Groups, 755 Pieces of Software, 47 Campaigns, 44 Mitigations, and 37 Data Sources Mobile: 12 Tactics, 75 Techniques, 46 Sub-Techniques, 15 Groups, 118 Pieces of Software, 3 Campaigns, 13 Mitigations, and 6 Data Sources ICS: 12 Tactics, 83 Techniques, 0 Sub-Techniques, 14 Groups, 23 Pieces of Software, 7 Campaigns, 52 Mitigations, 14 Assets, and 17 Data Sources Release Notes Terminology New: ATT&CK objects which are only present in the new release. Major version changes: ATT&CK objects that have a major version change. (e.g. 1.0 \u2192 2.0) Minor version changes: ATT&CK objects that have a minor version change. (e.g. 1.0 \u2192 1.1) Other version changes: ATT&CK objects that have a version change of any other kind. (e.g. 1.0 \u2192 1.2) Patches: ATT&CK objects that have been patched while keeping the version the same. (e.g., 1.0 \u2192 1.0 but something immaterial like a typo, a URL, or some metadata was fixed) Revocations: ATT&CK objects which are revoked by a different object. Deprecations: ATT&CK objects which are deprecated and no longer in use, and not replaced. Deletions: ATT&CK objects which are no longer found in the STIX data.

"content": " Updates - July 2019 Version Start Date End Date Data ATT&CK v5 July 31, 2019 October 23, 2019 v5.2 on MITRE/CTI The July 2019 release focuses on changes to how Mitigations in ATT&CK for Enterprise are represented and updates the Groups and Software entries. It does not contain updates to techniques- a larger technique update is planned for later this year. We're happy to check off another box on our planned changes this year, which was to modify how we represent mitigations in Enterprise so that the information is organized similar to how mitigations are handled in ATT&CK for Mobile. Mitigations in Enterprise are now treated like categories and are represented by objects similar to Groups and Software- one example being \"Multi-factor Authentication\". In the previous free-text mitigation fields, several techniques may reference multi-factor authentication as a potential way to mitigate a technique, but it was difficult to see which techniques a particular mitigation applies to without scouring the text fields across the techniques. Now each technique that a mitigation applies to will be associated to that mitigation category and the details of how each mitigation applies to a technique will appear in a table under the mitigations section. Each mitigation category has a page that lists all the techniques associated with it to give an at-a-glance view of coverage. In all, 40 new mitigation categories were created based on a text analysis of each technique where we pulled apart the definitions and binned them into like categories to consolidate the mitigation information in Enterprise. During the process of applying the new mitigation categories, we also did a bit of house cleaning on what mitigations are appropriate for certain techniques. We generally took the stance that if a mitigation does not directly apply to that specific behavior, then we removed it. For example, there were quite a few techniques that we removed application whitelisting (Execution Prevention) from because it was previously treated as a mitigation of last resort. Mitigations are represented as courses of action in STIX and will have the same ID numbering as Mobile mitigations (M####). The old mitigation text for techniques were placed into temporary mitigations objects with the full text field and will be included as deprecated mitigation objects. They are listed in STIX objects for historical purposes, but will not be present in the website. Those mitigation objects are labeled with the same technique ID (T####) as the technique they were associated to. The Effects tactic in ATT&CK for Mobile was renamed to Impact for consistency with the Enterprise Impact tactic. We've also updated the Enterprise tactic descriptions based on a contribution from Elly Searle at CrowdStrike to make them more straightforward, uniform, and easier to understand.

"content": " Updates - October 2022 Version Start Date End Date Data Changelogs ATT&CK v12 October 25, 2022 April 24, 2023 v12.0 on MITRE/CTIv12.1 on MITRE/CTI 11.3 - 12.0 Details (JSON)12.0 - 12.1 Details (JSON) The October 2022 (v12) ATT&CK release updates Techniques, Groups, and Software for Enterprise, Mobile, and ICS. The biggest changes in ATT&CK v12 are the addition of detections to ATT&CK for ICS, and the introduction of Campaigns. Matching the model introduced to ATT&CK for Enterprise in ATT&CK v11, ATT&CK for ICS detections describe ways of detecting various ICS techniques and are each tied to specific Data Sources and Data Components. This detection format was described in detail in our ATT&CK v11 release blog post. The new detections added leverage both traditional host and network-based collection as well as ICS specific sources such as Asset and Operational Databases. As there are overlaps between the Enterprise and ICS ATT&CK domains some ICS detections include references to Enterprise techniques where the additional context may assist defenders. This release introduces the Campaign data structure to ATT&CK and an initial limited set of Campaigns. ATT&CK's Campaigns are defined as a grouping of intrusion activity conducted over a specific period of time with common targets and objectives. A key aspect of Campaigns is that the activity may or may not be linked to a specific threat actor. Campaigns are described in detail in the blog post Introducing Campaigns to MITRE ATT&CK. Specifics on how Campaigns are implemented in ATT&CK's Enterprise, ICS, and Mobile STIX representations are described in ATT&CK's STIX 2.0 Data Model and STIX 2.1 Data Model. Several existing Groups were identified as more closely matching the Campaign than the Group definition and were converted to Campaigns. The 7 impacted groups were deprecated (noted below) and new Campaigns were created in their place. In this release we have renamed the Enterprise Technique \"Indicator Removal on Host\" to Indicator Removal (T1070) and rescoped it to better account for adversary behavior in cloud environments. This version of ATT&CK for Enterprise contains 14 Tactics, 193 Techniques, 401 Sub-techniques, 135 Groups, 14 Campaigns, and 718 Pieces of Software.

"content": " Updates - October 2018 Version Start Date End Date Data ATT&CK v3 October 23, 2018 April 29, 2019 v3.0 on MITRE/CTI Table of Contents Table of Contents Transition from MediaWiki Consolidated Technique and Software IDs Tactic IDs Mobile Mitigation IDs Versioning Techniques Groups Software Transition from MediaWiki The MediaWiki version of ATT&CK was moved to attack-old.mitre.org and will remain up until the end of January 2019. The old website will not be receiving content updates during this timeframe, so you will need to use the new website and STIX/TAXII to get the most up-to-date ATT&CK information. Consolidated Technique and Software IDs As of the October 2018 update all techniques across Enterprise ATT&CK, PRE-ATT&CK, and Mobile will have the same T#### numbering scheme. Existing PRE-ATT&CK and Mobile technique IDs have been converted over to the Enterprise IDs. Links to specific pages on the old wiki or to the new site with the old IDs will hit pages that redirect to the appropriate technique page. Mobile software IDs were converted to the Enterprise format of S####. NOTE: If you have created layers for the ATT&CK Navigator that include PRE-ATT&CK or Mobile ATT&CK techniques, you will need to update your layer files to use the new ATT&CK technique IDs. Tactic IDs Tactics have been given ID numbers formatted as TA####. Mobile Mitigation IDs Mobile migitations have been given ID numbers formatted as M####. Versioning We've implemented a versioning system to all ATT&CK objects (techniques, groups, software, Mobile mitigations) to enable better tracking of incremental changes to existing ATT&CK content. The system will consist of a MAJOR.MINOR number. All objects will start at version 1.0 with the October release. Techniques Major version changes Name change Technique scope change - Change in definition resulting in broadening or focusing the scope of the technique Minor version changes Minor descriptive information - technical information, examples, detection, mitigation, references Metadata change - platform, permissions, data sources, defense bypassed, etc. Groups Major version changes Adding or changing associated group or software Big changes to description and scope of a group Minor version changes Relationship to new techniques or software New references Software Major version changes Adding or changing an associated group or software High level description or information changes Metadata change (type) Minor version changes Relationship to new techniques or software New references Mobile Mitigations Major version changes Name change Scope, description, or information changes Minor version changes Metadata change Relationship to new techniques New references In addition, the ATT&CK Matrix view of techniques within an ATT&CK domain will be timestamped with the last change that impacts its structure and organization which will act as a version number for it. Techniques Enterprise New techniques: XSL Script Processing Template Injection File Permissions Modification Compiled HTML File Technique Changes: Port Knocking Modify Registry SID-History Injection Graphical User Interface Image File Execution Options Injection Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder NTFS File Attributes Indicator Removal on Host Indicator Blocking Component Firmware Binary Padding Shared Webroot Two-Factor Authentication Interception Change Default File Association Path Interception Extra Window Memory Injection Process Injection You can view the new and changed enterprise techniques in the ATT&CK Navigator by checking out the layer file we made available here. You can also check out a preview of the changes below! New techniques are green, and changed techniques are yellow. PRE-ATT&CK No changes Mobile The Obtain Device Access Matrix was collapsed into an Initial Access tactic to match the formatting of Enterprise. The Network-Based Effects Matrix was consolidated into two tactic categories: Network Effects and Remote Service Effects. Technique Additions and Changes: Deliver Malicious App via Authorized App Store created to consolidate several techniques in the old tactic Deliver Malicious App via Other Means created Drive-by Compromise renamed from Malicious Web Content Exploit via Radio Interfaces created to consolidate Exploit Baseband Vulnerability and Malicious SMS Message Install Insecure or Malicious Configuration created Supply Chain Compromise created to consolidate several techniques in the old tactic Updated Content: User interface spoofing You can view the new and changed mobile techniques in the ATT&CK Navigator by checking out the layer file we made available here.

"content": " Updates - October 2024 Version Start Date End Date Data Changelogs ATT&CK v16 October 31, 2024 April 21, 2025 v16.0 on MITRE/CTI v16.1 on MITRE/CTI 15.1 - 16.0 Details (JSON) 16.0 - 16.1 Details (JSON) The October 2024 (v16) ATT&CK release updates Techniques, Groups, Campaigns and Software for Enterprise. The biggest changes in ATT&CK v16 are a refactoring of Cloud platforms to better reflect real-world adversary activity along with improvements to platform descriptions, a dramatic expansion in the number of techniques with detection notes and analytics, and continued improvements to coverage of criminal threat actors. As a result of Cloud platform refactoring, the Azure AD, Office 365, and Google Workspace platforms have been removed from Enterprise ATT&CK and the Identity Provider and Office Suite platforms have been added in their place. An accompanying blog post describes these changes as well as additional improvements across Enterprise ATT&CK's various platforms. This release also includes a human-readable detailed changelog showing more specifically what changed in updated ATT&CK objects, and a machine-readable JSON changelog, whose format is described in ATT&CK's Github. This version of ATT&CK contains 844 Pieces of Software, 186 Groups, and 42 Campaigns Broken out by domain: Enterprise: 14 Tactics, 203 Techniques, 453 Sub-Techniques, 159 Groups, 710 Pieces of Software, 34 Campaigns, 44 Mitigations, and 37 Data Sources Mobile: 12 Tactics, 73 Techniques, 46 Sub-Techniques, 13 Groups, 112 Pieces of Software, 2 Campaigns, 13 Mitigations, and 6 Data Sources ICS: 12 Tactics, 83 Techniques, 0 Sub-Techniques, 14 Groups, 22 Pieces of Software, 6 Campaigns, 52 Mitigations, 14 Assets, and 17 Data Sources Release Notes Terminology New: ATT&CK objects which are only present in the new release.

"content": " Updates - March 2020 The March 2020 update for ATT&CK contains the beta release of sub-techniques for the Enterprise ATT&CK content. The beta site will be separate from the main (and still official) ATT&CK content for a period of approximately 3 months to allow for feedback and for users to assess their transition plans to ATT&CK with sub-techniques. In total, the sub-technique version of ATT&CK for Enterprise contains 156 techniques (reduced from 266) and 260 sub-techniques. See the accompanying blog post for more details.

The biggest changes are the restructuring of Detections, now tied to Data Source and Data Component objects in Enterprise ATT&CK, a beta release of ATT&CK for Mobile leveraging sub-techniques, and ATT&CK for ICS now on attack.mitre.org An accompanying blog post describes these changes as well as improvements across ATT&CK's various domains and platforms. This release contains a beta version of ATT&CK for Mobile represented using sub-techniques. The current stable version of ATT&CK for Mobile can still be found at https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/matrices/mobile/. Information on how to make the transition to this new version of ATT&CK for Mobile can be found in an accompanying blog post. A version of this beta content rendered in STIX can be found in our GitHub repo. In this release we have replaced the Enterprise Sub-Techniques Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Plist Modification (T1547.011) with Plist File Modification (T1647) and Scheduled Task/Job: At (Linux)(T1053.001) was incorporated into Scheduled Task/Job: At (T1053.002) in to better reflect adversary behavior. This version of ATT&CK for Enterprise contains 14 Tactics, 191 Techniques, 386 Sub-techniques, 134 Groups, and 680 Pieces of Software.

The biggest changes are the deprecation of the PRE-ATT&CK domain, the addition of two new Tactics to replace PRE-ATT&CK, and the addition of the Network platform to Enterprise ATT&CK. This version of ATT&CK for Enterprise contains 14 Tactics, 177 Techniques, and 348 Sub-techniques. Table of Contents Table of Contents Retirement of PRE-ATT&CK New techniques in Reconnaissance: New techniques in Resource Development: ATT&CK for Network Infrastructure Devices New and updated techniques for Network: Techniques Software Groups Mitigations Retirement of PRE-ATT&CK This release deprecates and removes the PRE-ATT&CK domain from ATT&CK, replacing its scope with two new Tactics in Enterprise ATT&CK Reconnaissance and Resource Development. A new platform has also been added to ATT&CK to represent the environment these techniques occur in, PRE. The previous contents of PRE-ATT&CK have been preserved here. See the accompanying blog post for more details.

These techniques are represented by a new platform in ATT&CK for Enterprise, Network. New and updated techniques for Network: Exploit Public-Facing Application Command and Scripting Interpreter Network Device CLI Pre-OS Boot ROMMONkit TFTP Boot Traffic Signaling Port Knocking Modify Authentication Process Network Device Authentication Modify System Image Downgrade System Image Patch System Image Network Boundary Bridging Network Address Translation Traversal Weaken Encryption Disable Crypto Hardware Reduce Key Space Data from Configuration Repository Network Device Configuration Dump SNMP (MIB Dump) Input Capture Keylogging Non-Application Layer Protocol Proxy Multi-hop Proxy Automated Exfiltration Traffic Duplication Many of the new Network techniques and sub-techniques focus on embedded network devices running closed source proprietary operating systems. This is largely driven by behaviors present in reported in the wild intrusions. Many newer devices leverage commodity embedded operating systems such as Linux or BSD variants, but accounts of adversary activity against these have been more sparse. However, network infrastructure devices running proprietary operating systems are still widely deployed on the Internet and within enterprises. We will continue to build out additional Network techniques and sub-techniques as they become known. We welcome contributions and feedback from the community and look to improve this representation of behaviors in the network infrastructure devices space. Techniques Enterprise We also added 1 additional new technique and 7 sub-techniques to Enterprise in this ATT&CK release beyond the scope of the above updates: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Print Processors Cloud Infrastructure Discovery Hide Artifacts: VBA Stomping Impair Defenses: Disable Cloud Logs Man-in-the-Middle: ARP Cache Poisoning Scheduled Task/Job: Systemd Timers Signed Binary Proxy Execution: Verclsid Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets: AS-REP Roasting All Enterprise technique changes are documented below.

Table of Contents Previous Versions Table of Contents Tactics and Techniques Groups Software Tactics and Techniques Enterprise Impact Tactic: The Impact Tactic was added to cover integrity and availability attacks against enterprise systems. Each technique will include an Impact Type label of 'Integrity' or 'Availability'.

You can also check out a preview of the changes below! New techniques are green, and changed techniques are yellow. PRE-ATT&CK Technique deprecations: Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA)- Moved under Enterprise with a new definition Mobile New Techniques: Web Service Groups On both Group and Software pages, we have changed the term \u201cAliases\u201d to \u201cAssociated Groups\u201d and \u201cAssociated Software\u201d respectively to better reflect what these terms represent. Analysts track clusters of activities using various analytic methodologies and terms such as threat groups, activity groups, threat actors, intrusion sets, and campaigns. Some groups have multiple names associated with similar activities due to various organizations tracking similar activities by different names. Malware/software faces the same challenge with different organizations assigning different names to the same or similar samples. Organizations' group and software names may partially overlap with names designated by other organizations and may disagree on specific activity. The MITRE ATT&CK team believes that tracking overlaps in activity for both groups and malware/software is useful to analysts, which is why we began tracking the \u201cAliases\u201d field many years ago. While we always recognized that these were not true, complete \u201caliases,\u201d we have realized that calling these \u201cAliases\u201d only furthers the confusion over group naming. Thus, we have decided to change the field \u201cAliases\u201d to \u201cAssociated Groups\u201d and \u201cAssociated Software\u201d to more accurately represent what we are trying to express. We make a best effort to track overlapping groups and software, but we do not represent these names as exact overlaps and encourage analysts to do additional research. If you have input on associated groups or software, please contact us.

"content": " Updates - October 2019 Version Start Date End Date Data ATT&CK v6 October 24, 2019 July 7, 2020 v6.3 on MITRE/CTI The October 2019 ATT&CK release updates techniques, Groups, and Software for both Enterprise and Mobile. The biggest change is the addition of cloud-focused techniques. Table of Contents Table of Contents ATT&CK for Cloud New techniques and updates for cloud: Techniques Software Groups Mitigations ATT&CK for Cloud 36 techniques have been added or updated to cover adversary behavior against cloud-based platforms. We\u2019ve added three infrastructure as a service (IaaS) platforms, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure (Azure), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The Software as a service (SaaS) platform will cover techniques against general cloud-based software platforms. Separately from IaaS and SaaS, we've also added two cloud software platforms, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Office 365, to cover techniques against those specific platforms. New techniques and updates for cloud: Application Access Token Cloud Instance Metadata API Cloud Service Dashboard Cloud Service Discovery Data from Cloud Storage Object Implant Container Image Internal Spearphishing Revert Cloud Instance Steal Application Access Token Steal Web Session Cookie Transfer Data to Cloud Account Unused Cloud Regions Web Session Cookie Account Discovery Account Manipulation Brute Force Create Account Credentials in Files Data from Information Repositories Data from Local System Data Staged Drive-by Compromise Email Collection Exploit Public-Facing Application Network Service Scanning Network Share Discovery Office Application Startup Permission Groups Discovery Redundant Access Remote System Discovery Resource Hijacking Spearphishing Link System Information Discovery System Network Connections Discovery Trusted Relationship Valid Accounts The majority of the people and organizations we talked to while defining what ATT&CK means in a cloud environment said that they consider it an extension of an enterprise network, so we made it part of ATT&CK for Enterprise instead of creating a separate model. The ATT&CK for Cloud matrix along with the individual platforms can still be viewed separately from the rest of the Enterprise matrix. Due to web applications being thought of as the new perimeter with cloud, we've had to expand the definition of Lateral Movement a bit to cover access and interaction with cloud-based systems and services. Common credentialing material such as web browser cookies and application access tokens like OAuth are commonplace and are targeted for access to cloud-based software. The current list of cloud platforms was selected based on input from contributors and what has been reported in incidents. We plan on re-evaluating them as needed to expand or refine them based on the threat landscape. We shifted priorities a bit this year to this effort because of the overwhelming demand for cloud coverage in ATT&CK. The lack of public incident reporting made it difficult to do, but we were able to use a lot of the community's expertise and knowledge in building it. ATT&CK for Cloud is the first new technology domain that has been created based on almost 100% community contributions for technique ideas! Cloud is by no means finished. We will continue to build out additional cloud-based techniques for another release next year. Techniques Enterprise View enterprise technique updates in the ATT&CK Navigator here.

The biggest changes in ATT&CK are related to the defensive portion of the framework. Detections in techniques have been replaced with Detection Strategies resulting in the addition of Detection Strategies and Analytics, major updates to Data Components, as well as the deprecation of Data Sources. ATT&CK's STIX representation, including these new objects, is described in detail in ATT&CK Data Model. A post describing the defensive changes to the ATT&CK website and the rationalle behind them was published to ATT&CK's Blog in July 2025, and an accompanying blog post describes changes across the release. In this release the Mobile Technique Abuse Accessibility Features has been un-deprecated (last seen in ATT&CK v6). This release also includes a human-readable detailed changelog showing more specifically what changed in updated ATT&CK objects, and a machine-readable JSON changelog, whose format is described in ATT&CK's Github.

Initial Access Tactic Addition Initial Access was added to ATT&CK and some techniques were added to Execution to cover the Launch and Compromise techniques within PRE-ATT&CK. The techniques were refactored to fit the enterprise level of detail. The following techniques were added under Initial Access: Drive-by Compromise Exploit Public-Facing Application Hardware Additions Spearphishing Attachment Spearphishing Link Spearphishing via Service Supply Chain Compromise Trusted Relationship The following existing techniques were cross-referenced into Initial Access: Replication Through Removable Media Valid Accounts The following techniques were added to Execution: Exploitation for Client Execution User Execution Techniques Aside from those added from PRE-ATT&CK, 23 additional new techniques were added - Up to 219 from 188: CMSTP Control Panel Items BITS Jobs SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking Password Policy Discovery Indirect Command Execution Exploitation for Client Execution User Execution Port Knocking Sudo Caching DCShadow Kerberoasting Time Providers Exploitation of Remote Services Exploitation for Defense Evasion Exploitation for Credential Access Data from Information Repositories Credentials in Registry Kernel Modules and Extensions Signed Script Proxy Execution Browser Bookmark Discovery Signed Binary Proxy Execution Remote Access Tools One technique renamed NTFS Extended Attributes -> NTFS File Attributes Moderate to major updates to scope and/or content Winlogon Helper DLL Credential Dumping NTFS File Attributes Web Service Taint Shared Content Groups and Software Nine new groups: FIN8 TA459 BlackOasis APT33 Leviathan Elderwood APT37 PLATINUM MuddyWater Group Updates Patchwork combined with Monsoon, G0042 redirects to G0040 Groups with New Techniques Added Axiom APT28 APT29 APT3 Lazarus Group menuPass APT34 Carbanak Night Dragon FIN7 APT32 45 new software entries: ISMInjector BITSAdmin Winexe Pupy Forfiles PowerSploit SDelete PUNCHBUGGY PUNCHTRACK NETWIRE TURNEDUP Dipsind JPIN adbupd Hydraq Briba Naid Wiarp Vasport Pasam Darkmoon Nerex Linfo CORALDECK DOGCALL HAPPYWORK KARAE POORAIM SHUTTERSPEED SLOWDRIFT WINERACK Chaos Umbreon CCBkdr POWERSTATS Havij sqlmap Smoke Loader spwebmember NanHaiShu Orz ZeroT Invoke-PSImage HOMEFRY MURKYTOP Other Changes Exploitation of Vulnerability Breakout - With the addition of Initial Access, more clarity was needed to define software exploitation behavior. The original Exploitation of Vulnerability technique was broken out into six variations specifically for individual tactics. Initial Access - Exploit Public-Facing Application Execution - Exploitation for Client Execution Privilege Escalation - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation: maintains the original Exploitation of Vulnerability technique ID T1068 Lateral Movement - Exploitation of Remote Services Defense Evasion - Exploitation for Defense Evasion Credential Access - Exploitation for Credential Access Software Platforms - Added Windows, Linux, and macOS tags for software objects. What's New in PRE-ATT&CK? This release deprecates the Launch and Compromise tactics and most of the techniques that belong to them. In the future, these TTPs will be covered by techniques in the Initial Access and Execution tactics on ATT&CK. 2 tactics deprecated: Launch and Compromise Disseminate removable media has been moved from Launch to Stage Capabilities A new technique, Spearphishing for Information, has been added to Technical Information Gathering 23 techniques have been deprecated in this release PRE-ATT&CK now comprises 15 tactics and 151 techniques "

The biggest changes in ATT&CK v13 are the addition of detailed detection guidance to some Techniques in ATT&CK for Enterprise, Mobile Data Sources, and two new types of changelogs to help identify more precisely what has changed in ATT&CK. An accompanying blog post describes these changes as well as improvements across ATT&CK's various domains and platforms. This release includes a new human-readable detailed changelog showing more specifically what changed in updated ATT&CK objects, and a new machine-readable JSON changelog, whose format is described in ATT&CK's Github. The terminology used in these release notes has also been updated to better describe the changes to various ATT&CK objects: New objects: ATT&CK objects which are only present in the new release. Major version changes: ATT&CK objects that have a major version change. (e.g., 1.0 \u2192 2.0) Minor version changes: ATT&CK objects that have a minor version change. (e.g., 1.0 \u2192 1.1) Patches: ATT&CK objects that have been patched while keeping the version the same. (e.g., 1.0 \u2192 1.0 but something like a typo, a URL, or some metadata was fixed) Object revocations: ATT&CK objects which are revoked by a different object. Object deprecations: ATT&CK objects which are deprecated and no longer in use, and not replaced. Object deletions: ATT&CK objects which are no longer found in the STIX data. This version of ATT&CK for Enterprise contains 14 Tactics, 196 Techniques, 411 Sub-techniques, 138 Groups, 22 Campaigns, and 740 Pieces of Software.

"content": " Updates - July 2020 Version Start Date End Date Data ATT&CK v7 July 8, 2020 October 26, 2020 v7.0 on MITRE/CTI The July 2020 (v7) ATT&CK release updates Techniques, Groups, and Software for both Enterprise and Mobile. This is the first non-beta release of Enterprise ATT&CK represented with sub-techniques. The pre sub-technique version of ATT&CK has been preserved here. Most of this content was released as a beta in March 2020, and changes between the beta release and this release are documented separately. In total, the sub-technique version of ATT&CK for Enterprise contains 156 techniques (reduced from 266) and 272 sub-techniques. See the accompanying blog post for more details. In this same release we have deprecated white/blacklist language in ATT&CK. Techniques and mitigations previously containing this language have either been reworded or the language has been replaced with allow/denylist. In line with industry terminology changes, application whitelisting and process whitelisting have both been replaced with application control. Techniques Enterprise View enterprise technique updates in the ATT&CK Navigator here.
