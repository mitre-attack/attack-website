"content": " Enterprise Mitigations Mitigations represent security concepts and classes of technologies that can be used to prevent a technique or sub-technique from being successfully executed. Mitigations: 44 ID Name Description M1036 Account Use Policies Configure features related to account use like login attempt lockouts, specific login times, etc. M1015 Active Directory Configuration Implement robust Active Directory configurations using group policies to control access and reduce the attack surface. Specific examples include: M1049 Antivirus/Antimalware Use signatures or heuristics to detect malicious software. M1013 Application Developer Guidance This mitigation describes any guidance or training given to developers of applications to avoid introducing security weaknesses that an adversary may be able to take advantage of. M1048 Application Isolation and Sandboxing Restrict execution of code to a virtual environment on or in transit to an endpoint system. M1047 Audit Perform audits or scans of systems, permissions, insecure software, insecure configurations, etc. to identify potential weaknesses. M1040 Behavior Prevention on Endpoint Use capabilities to prevent suspicious behavior patterns from occurring on endpoint systems. This could include suspicious process, file, API call, etc. behavior. M1046 Boot Integrity Use secure methods to boot a system and verify the integrity of the operating system and loading mechanisms. M1045 Code Signing Enforce binary and application integrity with digital signature verification to prevent untrusted code from executing. M1043 Credential Access Protection Use capabilities to prevent successful credential access by adversaries; including blocking forms of credential dumping. M1053 Data Backup Take and store data backups from end user systems and critical servers. Ensure backup and storage systems are hardened and kept separate from the corporate network to prevent compromise. M1057 Data Loss Prevention Use a data loss prevention (DLP) strategy to categorize sensitive data, identify data formats indicative of personal identifiable information (PII), and restrict exfiltration of sensitive data. M1042 Disable or Remove Feature or Program Remove or deny access to unnecessary and potentially vulnerable software to prevent abuse by adversaries. M1055 Do Not Mitigate This category is to associate techniques that mitigation might increase risk of compromise and therefore mitigation is not recommended. M1041 Encrypt Sensitive Information Protect sensitive information with strong encryption. M1039 Environment Variable Permissions Prevent modification of environment variables by unauthorized users and groups. M1038 Execution Prevention Block execution of code on a system through application control, and/or script blocking. M1050 Exploit Protection Use capabilities to detect and block conditions that may lead to or be indicative of a software exploit occurring. M1037 Filter Network Traffic Use network appliances to filter ingress or egress traffic and perform protocol-based filtering. Configure software on endpoints to filter network traffic. M1035 Limit Access to Resource Over Network Prevent access to file shares, remote access to systems, unnecessary services. Mechanisms to limit access may include use of network concentrators, RDP gateways, etc. M1034 Limit Hardware Installation Block users or groups from installing or using unapproved hardware on systems, including USB devices. M1033 Limit Software Installation Block users or groups from installing unapproved software. M1032 Multi-factor Authentication Use two or more pieces of evidence to authenticate to a system; such as username and password in addition to a token from a physical smart card or token generator. M1031 Network Intrusion Prevention Use intrusion detection signatures to block traffic at network boundaries. M1030 Network Segmentation Architect sections of the network to isolate critical systems, functions, or resources. Use physical and logical segmentation to prevent access to potentially sensitive systems and information. Use a DMZ to contain any internet-facing services that should not be exposed from the internal network. Configure separate virtual private cloud (VPC) instances to isolate critical cloud systems. M1028 Operating System Configuration Make configuration changes related to the operating system or a common feature of the operating system that result in system hardening against techniques. M1060 Out-of-Band Communications Channel Establish secure out-of-band communication channels to ensure the continuity of critical communications during security incidents, data integrity attacks, or in-network communication failures. Out-of-band communication refers to using an alternative, separate communication path that is not dependent on the potentially compromised primary network infrastructure. This method can include secure messaging apps, encrypted phone lines, satellite communications, or dedicated emergency communication systems. Leveraging these alternative channels reduces the risk of adversaries intercepting, disrupting, or tampering with sensitive communications and helps coordinate an effective incident response. M1027 Password Policies Set and enforce secure password policies for accounts. M1056 Pre-compromise This category is used for any applicable mitigation activities that apply to techniques occurring before an adversary gains Initial Access, such as Reconnaissance and Resource Development techniques. M1026 Privileged Account Management Manage the creation, modification, use, and permissions associated to privileged accounts, including SYSTEM and root. M1025 Privileged Process Integrity Protect processes with high privileges that can be used to interact with critical system components through use of protected process light, anti-process injection defenses, or other process integrity enforcement measures. M1029 Remote Data Storage Use remote security log and sensitive file storage where access can be controlled better to prevent exposure of intrusion detection log data or sensitive information. M1022 Restrict File and Directory Permissions Restrict access by setting directory and file permissions that are not specific to users or privileged accounts. M1044 Restrict Library Loading Prevent abuse of library loading mechanisms in the operating system and software to load untrusted code by configuring appropriate library loading mechanisms and investigating potential vulnerable software. M1024 Restrict Registry Permissions Restrict the ability to modify certain hives or keys in the Windows Registry. M1021 Restrict Web-Based Content Restrict use of certain websites, block downloads/attachments, block Javascript, restrict browser extensions, etc. M1054 Software Configuration Implement configuration changes to software (other than the operating system) to mitigate security risks associated to how the software operates. M1020 SSL/TLS Inspection Break and inspect SSL/TLS sessions to look at encrypted web traffic for adversary activity. M1019 Threat Intelligence Program A threat intelligence program helps an organization generate their own threat intelligence information and track trends to inform defensive priorities to mitigate risk. M1051 Update Software Perform regular software updates to mitigate exploitation risk. M1052 User Account Control Configure Windows User Account Control to mitigate risk of adversaries obtaining elevated process access. M1018 User Account Management Manage the creation, modification, use, and permissions associated to user accounts. M1017 User Training Train users to be aware of access or manipulation attempts by an adversary to reduce the risk of successful spearphishing, social engineering, and other techniques that involve user interaction. M1016 Vulnerability Scanning Vulnerability scanning is used to find potentially exploitable software vulnerabilities to remediate them. "

Specific examples include: Account Configuration: Use provisioned domain accounts rather than local accounts to leverage centralized control and auditing capabilities. Interactive Logon Restrictions: Enforce group policies that prohibit interactive logons for accounts that should not directly access systems. Remote Desktop Settings: Limit Remote Desktop logons to authorized accounts to prevent misuse by adversaries. Dedicated Administrative Accounts: Create specialized domain-wide accounts that are restricted from interactive logons but can perform specific tasks like installations or repository access. Authentication Silos: Configure Authentication Silos in Active Directory to create access zones with restrictions based on membership in the Protected Users global security group.

Consider applying SID Filtering to interforest trusts, such as forest trusts and external trusts, to exclude SID-History from requests to access domain resources. SID Filtering ensures that any authentication requests over a trust only contain SIDs of security principals from the trusted domain (i.e preventing the trusted domain from claiming a user has membership in groups outside of the domain). SID Filtering of forest trusts is enabled by default, but may have been disabled in some cases to allow a child domain to transitively access forest trusts. SID Filtering of external trusts is automatically enabled on all created external trusts using Server 2003 or later domain controllers. [1] [2] However note that SID Filtering is not automatically applied to legacy trusts or may have been deliberately disabled to allow inter-domain access to resources. SID Filtering can be applied by: [3] Disabling SIDHistory on forest trusts using the netdom tool (netdom trust /domain: /EnableSIDHistory:no on the domain controller) Applying SID Filter Quarantining to external trusts using the netdom tool (netdom trust /domain: /quarantine:yes on the domain controller) Applying SID Filtering to domain trusts within a single forest is not recommended as it is an unsupported configuration and can cause breaking changes. [3] [4] If a domain within a forest is untrustworthy then it should not be a member of the forest. In this situation it is necessary to first split the trusted and untrusted domains into separate forests where SID Filtering can be applied to an interforest trust Enterprise T1606 .002 Forge Web Credentials: SAML Tokens For containing the impact of a previously forged SAML token, rotate the token-signing AD FS certificate in rapid succession twice, which will invalidate any tokens generated using the previous certificate.[5] Enterprise T1003 OS Credential Dumping Manage the access control list for \"Replicating Directory Changes All\" and other permissions associated with domain controller replication.

This should be done extensively on all applications in order to establish a baseline, followed up on with periodic audits of new or updated applications. Suspicious applications should be investigated and removed. Enterprise T1649 Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates Check and remediate unneeded existing authentication certificates as well as common abusable misconfigurations of CA settings and permissions, such as AD CS certificate enrollment permissions and published overly permissive certificate templates (which define available settings for created certificates). For example, available AD CS certificate templates can be checked via the Certificate Authority MMC snap-in (certsrv.msc). certutil.exe can also be used to examine various information within an AD CS CA database.[26][27][28] Enterprise T1558 Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets Perform audits or scans of systems, permissions, insecure software, insecure configurations, etc. to identify potential weaknesses. .004 AS-REP Roasting Kerberos preauthentication is enabled by default. Older protocols might not support preauthentication therefore it is possible to have this setting disabled. Make sure that all accounts have preauthentication whenever possible and audit changes to setting. Windows tools such as PowerShell may be used to easily find which accounts have preauthentication disabled. [29][30] .005 Ccache Files Enable and perform audits or scans of systems, permissions, insecure software, insecure configurations, etc. to identify potential weaknesses.[31] For example, use auditd to audit access to hashes, machine tickets, or /tmp files. If using sssd and Vintela, ensure kerberos is disabled if not being used.[32] Enterprise T1539 Steal Web Session Cookie Implement auditing for authentication activities and user logins to detect the use of stolen session cookies. Monitor for impossible travel scenarios and anomalous behavior that could indicate the use of compromised session tokens or cookies. Enterprise T1552 Unsecured Credentials Preemptively search for files containing passwords or other credentials and take actions to reduce the exposure risk when found. .001 Credentials In Files Preemptively search for files containing passwords and take actions to reduce the exposure risk when found. .002 Credentials in Registry Proactively search for credentials within the Registry and attempt to remediate the risk. .004 Private Keys Ensure only authorized keys are allowed access to critical resources and audit access lists regularly. .006 Group Policy Preferences Search SYSVOL for any existing GGPs that may contain credentials and remove them.[33] .008 Chat Messages Preemptively search through communication services to find shared unsecured credentials. Searching for common patterns like \"password is \", \"password=\" and take actions to reduce exposure when found. Enterprise T1550 Use Alternate Authentication Material Perform audits or scans of systems, permissions, insecure software, insecure configurations, etc. to identify potential weaknesses. .001 Application Access Token Administrators should audit all cloud and container accounts to ensure that they are necessary and that the permissions granted to them are appropriate. Where possible, the ability to request temporary account tokens on behalf of another accounts should be disabled. Additionally, administrators can leverage audit tools to monitor actions that can be conducted as a result of OAuth 2.0 access. For instance, audit reports enable admins to identify privilege escalation actions such as role creations or policy modifications, which could be actions performed after initial access.

ICS T0845 Program Upload All field controllers should restrict program uploads to only certain users (e.g., engineers, field technician), preferably through implementing a role-based access mechanism. ICS T0886 Remote Services Provide privileges corresponding to the restriction of a GUI session to control system operations (examples include HMI read-only vs. read-write modes). Ensure local users, such as operators and engineers, are giving prioritization over remote sessions and have the authority to regain control over a remote session if needed. Prevent remote access sessions (e.g., RDP, VNC) from taking over local sessions, especially those used for ICS control, especially HMIs.

"title": "Mitigations - ICS",
"path": "/mitigations/ics/index.html",
"content": " ICS Mitigations Mitigations represent security concepts and classes of technologies that can be used to prevent a technique or sub-technique from being successfully executed. Mitigations: 52 ID Name Description M0801 Access Management Access Management technologies can be used to enforce authorization polices and decisions, especially when existing field devices do not provided sufficient capabilities to support user identification and authentication. These technologies typically utilize an in-line network device or gateway system to prevent access to unauthenticated users, while also integrating with an authentication service to first verify user credentials. M0936 Account Use Policies Configure features related to account use like login attempt lockouts, specific login times, etc. M0915 Active Directory Configuration Configure Active Directory to prevent use of certain techniques; use security identifier (SID) Filtering, etc. M0949 Antivirus/Antimalware Use signatures or heuristics to detect malicious software. Within industrial control environments, antivirus/antimalware installations should be limited to assets that are not involved in critical or real-time operations. To minimize the impact to system availability, all products should first be validated within a representative test environment before deployment to production systems. M0913 Application Developer Guidance This mitigation describes any guidance or training given to developers of applications to avoid introducing security weaknesses that an adversary may be able to take advantage of. M0948 Application Isolation and Sandboxing Restrict the execution of code to a virtual environment on or in-transit to an endpoint system. M0947 Audit Perform audits or scans of systems, permissions, insecure software, insecure configurations, etc. to identify potential weaknesses. Perform periodic integrity checks of the device to validate the correctness of the firmware, software, programs, and configurations. Integrity checks, which typically include cryptographic hashes or digital signatures, should be compared to those obtained at known valid states, especially after events like device reboots, program downloads, or program restarts. M0800 Authorization Enforcement The device or system should restrict read, manipulate, or execute privileges to only authenticated users who require access based on approved security policies. Role-based Access Control (RBAC) schemes can help reduce the overhead of assigning permissions to the large number of devices within an ICS. For example, IEC 62351 provides examples of roles used to support common system operations within the electric power sector , while IEEE 1686 defines standard permissions for users of IEDs. M0946 Boot Integrity Use secure methods to boot a system and verify the integrity of the operating system and loading mechanisms. M0945 Code Signing Enforce binary and application integrity with digital signature verification to prevent untrusted code from executing. M0802 Communication Authenticity When communicating over an untrusted network, utilize secure network protocols that both authenticate the message sender and can verify its integrity. This can be done either through message authentication codes (MACs) or digital signatures, to detect spoofed network messages and unauthorized connections. M0953 Data Backup Take and store data backups from end user systems and critical servers. Ensure backup and storage systems are hardened and kept separate from the corporate network to prevent compromise. Maintain and exercise incident response plans , including the management of 'gold-copy' back-up images and configurations for key systems to enable quick recovery and response from adversarial activities that impact control, view, or availability. M0803 Data Loss Prevention Data Loss Prevention (DLP) technologies can be used to help identify adversarial attempts to exfiltrate operational information, such as engineering plans, trade secrets, recipes, intellectual property, or process telemetry. DLP functionality may be built into other security products such as firewalls or standalone suites running on the network and host-based agents. DLP may be configured to prevent the transfer of information through corporate resources such as email, web, and physical media such as USB for host-based solutions. M0942 Disable or Remove Feature or Program Remove or deny access to unnecessary and potentially vulnerable software to prevent abuse by adversaries. M0808 Encrypt Network Traffic Utilize strong cryptographic techniques and protocols to prevent eavesdropping on network communications. M0941 Encrypt Sensitive Information Protect sensitive data-at-rest with strong encryption. M0938 Execution Prevention Block execution of code on a system through application control, and/or script blocking. M0950 Exploit Protection Use capabilities to detect and block conditions that may lead to or be indicative of a software exploit occurring. M0937 Filter Network Traffic Use network appliances to filter ingress or egress traffic and perform protocol-based filtering. Configure software on endpoints to filter network traffic. Perform inline allow/denylisting of network messages based on the application layer (OSI Layer 7) protocol, especially for automation protocols. Application allowlists are beneficial when there are well-defined communication sequences, types, rates, or patterns needed during expected system operations. Application denylists may be needed if all acceptable communication sequences cannot be defined, but instead a set of known malicious uses can be denied (e.g., excessive communication attempts, shutdown messages, invalid commands). Devices performing these functions are often referred to as deep-packet inspection (DPI) firewalls, context-aware firewalls, or firewalls blocking specific automation/SCADA protocol aware firewalls. M0804 Human User Authentication Require user authentication before allowing access to data or accepting commands to a device. While strong multi-factor authentication is preferable, it is not always feasible within ICS environments. Performing strong user authentication also requires additional security controls and processes which are often the target of related adversarial techniques (e.g., Valid Accounts, Default Credentials). Therefore, associated ATT&CK mitigations should be considered in addition to this, including Multi-factor Authentication, Account Use Policies, Password Policies, User Account Management, Privileged Account Management, and User Account Control. M0935 Limit Access to Resource Over Network Prevent access to file shares, remote access to systems, unnecessary services. Mechanisms to limit access may include use of network concentrators, RDP gateways, etc. M0934 Limit Hardware Installation Block users or groups from installing or using unapproved hardware on systems, including USB devices. M0805 Mechanical Protection Layers Utilize a layered protection design based on physical or mechanical protection systems to prevent damage to property, equipment, human safety, or the environment. Examples include interlocks, rupture disk, release values, etc. M0806 Minimize Wireless Signal Propagation Wireless signals frequently propagate outside of organizational boundaries, which provide opportunities for adversaries to monitor or gain unauthorized access to the wireless network. To minimize this threat, organizations should implement measures to detect, understand, and reduce unnecessary RF propagation. M0816 Mitigation Limited or Not Effective This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventative controls since it is based on the abuse of system features. M0932 Multi-factor Authentication Use two or more pieces of evidence to authenticate to a system; such as username and password in addition to a token from a physical smart card or token generator. Within industrial control environments assets such as low-level controllers, workstations, and HMIs have real-time operational control and safety requirements which may restrict the use of multi-factor. M0807 Network Allowlists Network allowlists can be implemented through either host-based files or system hosts files to specify what connections (e.g., IP address, MAC address, port, protocol) can be made from a device. Allowlist techniques that operate at the application layer (e.g., DNP3, Modbus, HTTP) are addressed in Filter Network Traffic mitigation. M0931 Network Intrusion Prevention Use intrusion detection signatures to block traffic at network boundaries. In industrial control environments, network intrusion prevention should be configured so it will not disrupt protocols and communications responsible for real-time functions related to control or safety. M0930 Network Segmentation Architect sections of the network to isolate critical systems, functions, or resources. Use physical and logical segmentation to prevent access to potentially sensitive systems and information. Use a DMZ to contain any internet-facing services that should not be exposed from the internal network. Restrict network access to only required systems and services. In addition, prevent systems from other networks or business functions (e.g., enterprise) from accessing critical process control systems. For example, in IEC 62443, systems within the same secure level should be grouped into a zone, and access to that zone is restricted by a conduit, or mechanism to restrict data flows between zones by segmenting the network. M0928 Operating System Configuration Make configuration changes related to the operating system or a common feature of the operating system that result in system hardening against techniques. M0809 Operational Information Confidentiality Deploy mechanisms to protect the confidentiality of information related to operational processes, facility locations, device configurations, programs, or databases that may have information that can be used to infer organizational trade-secrets, recipes, and other intellectual property (IP). M0810 Out-of-Band Communications Channel Have alternative methods to support communication requirements during communication failures and data integrity attacks. M0927 Password Policies Set and enforce secure password policies for accounts. M0926 Privileged Account Management Manage the creation, modification, use, and permissions associated to privileged accounts, including SYSTEM and root. M0811 Redundancy of Service Redundancy could be provided for both critical ICS devices and services, such as back-up devices or hot-standbys. M0922 Restrict File and Directory Permissions Restrict access by setting directory and file permissions that are not specific to users or privileged accounts. M0944 Restrict Library Loading Prevent abuse of library loading mechanisms in the operating system and software to load untrusted code by configuring appropriate library loading mechanisms and investigating potential vulnerable software. M0924 Restrict Registry Permissions Restrict the ability to modify certain hives or keys in the Windows Registry. M0921 Restrict Web-Based Content Restrict use of certain websites, block downloads/attachments, block Javascript, restrict browser extensions, etc. M0812 Safety Instrumented Systems Utilize Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) to provide an additional layer of protection to hazard scenarios that may cause property damage. A SIS will typically include sensors, logic solvers, and a final control element that can be used to automatically respond to an hazardous condition . Ensure that all SISs are segmented from operational networks to prevent them from being targeted by additional adversarial behavior. M0954 Software Configuration Implement configuration changes to software (other than the operating system) to mitigate security risks associated with how the software operates. M0813 Software Process and Device Authentication Require the authentication of devices and software processes where appropriate. Devices that connect remotely to other systems should require strong authentication to prevent spoofing of communications. Furthermore, software processes should also require authentication when accessing APIs. M0920 SSL/TLS Inspection Break and inspect SSL/TLS sessions to look at encrypted web traffic for adversary activity. M0814 Static Network Configuration Configure hosts and devices to use static network configurations when possible, protocols that require dynamic discovery/addressing (e.g., ARP, DHCP, DNS) can be used to manipulate network message forwarding and enable various AiTM attacks. This mitigation may not always be usable due to limited device features or challenges introduced with different network configurations. M0817 Supply Chain Management Implement a supply chain management program, including policies and procedures to ensure all devices and components originate from a trusted supplier and are tested to verify their integrity. M0919 Threat Intelligence Program A threat intelligence program helps an organization generate their own threat intelligence information and track trends to inform defensive priorities to mitigate risk. M0951 Update Software Perform regular software updates to mitigate exploitation risk. Software updates may need to be scheduled around operational down times. M0918 User Account Management Manage the creation, modification, use, and permissions associated to user accounts. M0917 User Training Train users to be aware of access or manipulation attempts by an adversary to reduce the risk of successful spearphishing, social engineering, and other techniques that involve user interaction. M0818 Validate Program Inputs Devices and programs designed to interact with control system parameters should validate the format and content of all user inputs and actions to ensure the values are within intended operational ranges. These values should be evaluated and further enforced through the program logic running on the field controller. If a problematic or invalid input is identified, the programs should either utilize a predetermined safe value or enter a known safe state, while also logging or alerting on the event. M0916 Vulnerability Scanning Vulnerability scanning is used to find potentially exploitable software vulnerabilities to remediate them. M0815 Watchdog Timers Utilize watchdog timers to ensure devices can quickly detect whether a system is unresponsive. "

This is typically used for a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) deployment. Mobile T1461 Lockscreen Bypass Enterprises can provision policies to mobile devices that require a minimum complexity (length, character requirements, etc.) for the device passcode, and cause the device to wipe all data if an incorrect passcode is entered too many times. Both policies would mitigate brute-force, guessing, or shoulder surfing of the device passcode. Enterprises can also provision policies to disable biometric authentication, however, biometric authentication can help make using a longer, more complex passcode more practical because it does not need to be entered as frequently. Mobile T1663 Remote Access Software When devices are enrolled in an EMM/MDM using device owner (iOS) or fully managed (Android) mode, the EMM/MDM can collect a list of installed applications on the device. An administrator can then act on, for example blocking, specific remote access applications from being installed on managed devices.

Mobile T1420 File and Directory Discovery Security architecture improvements in each new version of Android and iOS make it more difficult to escalate privileges. Additionally, newer versions of Android have strengthened the sandboxing applied to applications, restricting their ability to enumerate file system contents. Mobile T1628 .001 Hide Artifacts: Suppress Application Icon Android 10 introduced changes to prevent malicious applications from fully suppressing their icon in the launcher.[7][8] Mobile T1629 .001 Impair Defenses: Prevent Application Removal Recent versions of Android modified how device administrator applications are uninstalled, making it easier for the user to remove them. .002 Impair Defenses: Device Lockout Recent versions of Android modified how device administrator applications are uninstalled, making it easier for the user to remove them. Android 7 introduced updates that revoke standard device administrators\u2019 ability to reset the device\u2019s passcode. Mobile T1417 Input Capture The HIDE_OVERLAY_WINDOWS permission was introduced in Android 12 allowing apps to hide overlay windows of type TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY drawn by other apps with the SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission, preventing other applications from creating overlay windows on top of the current application.[9] .002 GUI Input Capture The HIDE_OVERLAY_WINDOWS permission was introduced in Android 12 allowing apps to hide overlay windows of type TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY drawn by other apps with the SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission, preventing other applications from creating overlay windows on top of the current application.[9] Mobile T1430 Location Tracking On Android 11 and up, users are not prompted with the option to select \"Allow all the time\" and must navigate to the settings page to manually select this option.

Enterprise T1485 Data Destruction Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) delete for cloud storage resources, such as AWS S3 buckets, to prevent unauthorized deletion of critical data and infrastructure. MFA delete requires additional authentication steps, making it significantly more difficult for adversaries to destroy data without proper credentials. This additional security layer helps protect against the impact of data destruction in cloud environments by ensuring that only authenticated actions can irreversibly delete storage or machine images. Enterprise T1530 Data from Cloud Storage Consider using multi-factor authentication to restrict access to resources and cloud storage APIs.[5] Enterprise T1213 Data from Information Repositories Use two or more pieces of evidence to authenticate to a system; such as username and password in addition to a token from a physical smart card or token generator. .003 Code Repositories Use multi-factor authentication for logons to code repositories.

Enterprise T1072 Software Deployment Tools Ensure proper system and access isolation for critical network systems through use of multi-factor authentication. Enterprise T1539 Steal Web Session Cookie A physical second factor key that uses the target login domain as part of the negotiation protocol will prevent session cookie theft through proxy methods.[9] Implement Conditional Access policies with Token Protection to bind session tokens to their originating device and user. This reduces the risk of session cookie theft by ensuring that stolen tokens cannot be reused from unauthorized locations or devices. Enterprise T1199 Trusted Relationship Require MFA for all delegated administrator accounts.[10] Enterprise T1078 Valid Accounts Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all account types, including default, local, domain, and cloud accounts, to prevent unauthorized access, even if credentials are compromised. MFA provides a critical layer of security by requiring multiple forms of verification beyond just a password. This measure significantly reduces the risk of adversaries abusing valid accounts to gain initial access, escalate privileges, maintain persistence, or evade defenses within your network. .001 Default Accounts Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for default accounts whenever possible to prevent unauthorized access, even if credentials for these accounts are compromised. MFA adds an additional layer of security that requires more than just a username and password, making it significantly harder for adversaries to exploit these accounts for initial access or lateral movement. .002 Domain Accounts Integrating multi-factor authentication (MFA) as part of organizational policy can greatly reduce the risk of an adversary gaining control of valid credentials that may be used for additional tactics such as initial access, lateral movement, and collecting information. MFA can also be used to restrict access to cloud resources and APIs. .003 Local Accounts Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for local accounts to add an extra layer of protection against credential theft and misuse. MFA can be implemented using methods like mobile-based authenticators or hardware tokens, even in environments that do not rely on domain controllers or cloud services. This additional security measure can help reduce the risk of adversaries gaining unauthorized access to local systems and resources. .004 Cloud Accounts Use multi-factor authentication for cloud accounts, especially privileged accounts. This can be implemented in a variety of forms (e.g. hardware, virtual, SMS), and can also be audited using administrative reporting features.[11] References A. Randazzo, B. Manahan and S. Lipton.

"content": " Mobile Mitigations Mitigations represent security concepts and classes of technologies that can be used to prevent a technique or sub-technique from being successfully executed. Mitigations: 13 ID Name Description M1058 Antivirus/Antimalware Mobile security products, such as Mobile Threat Defense (MTD), offer various device-based mitigations against certain behaviors. M1013 Application Developer Guidance This mitigation describes any guidance or training given to developers of applications to avoid introducing security weaknesses that an adversary may be able to take advantage of. M1002 Attestation Enable remote attestation capabilities when available (such as Android SafetyNet or Samsung Knox TIMA Attestation) and prohibit devices that fail the attestation from accessing enterprise resources. M1010 Deploy Compromised Device Detection Method A variety of methods exist that can be used to enable enterprises to identify compromised (e.g. rooted/jailbroken) devices, whether using security mechanisms built directly into the device, third-party mobile security applications, enterprise mobility management (EMM)/mobile device management (MDM) capabilities, or other methods. Some methods may be trivial to evade while others may be more sophisticated. M1059 Do Not Mitigate This category is to associate techniques that mitigation might increase risk of compromise and therefore mitigation is not recommended. M1009 Encrypt Network Traffic Application developers should encrypt all of their application network traffic using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to ensure protection of sensitive data and deter network-based attacks. If desired, application developers could perform message-based encryption of data before passing it for TLS encryption. M1012 Enterprise Policy An enterprise mobility management (EMM), also known as mobile device management (MDM), system can be used to provision policies to mobile devices to control aspects of their allowed behavior. M1014 Interconnection Filtering In order to mitigate Signaling System 7 (SS7) exploitation, the Communications, Security, Reliability, and Interoperability Council (CSRIC) describes filtering interconnections between network operators to block inappropriate requests . M1003 Lock Bootloader On devices that provide the capability to unlock the bootloader (hence allowing any operating system code to be flashed onto the device), perform periodic checks to ensure that the bootloader is locked. M1001 Security Updates Install security updates in response to discovered vulnerabilities. M1004 System Partition Integrity Ensure that Android devices being used include and enable the Verified Boot capability, which cryptographically ensures the integrity of the system partition. M1006 Use Recent OS Version New mobile operating system versions bring not only patches against discovered vulnerabilities but also often bring security architecture improvements that provide resilience against potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses that have not yet been discovered. They may also bring improvements that block use of observed adversary techniques. M1011 User Guidance Describes any guidance or training given to users to set particular configuration settings or avoid specific potentially risky behaviors. "

Also consider training users on procedures to prevent and respond to swatting and doxing, acts increasingly deployed by financially motivated groups to further coerce victims into satisfying ransom/extortion demands.[2][3] Enterprise T1656 Impersonation Train users to be aware of impersonation tricks and how to counter them, for example confirming incoming requests through an independent platform like a phone call or in-person, to reduce risk. Enterprise T1056 .002 Input Capture: GUI Input Capture Use user training as a way to bring awareness and raise suspicion for potentially malicious events and dialog boxes (ex: Office documents prompting for credentials). Enterprise T1036 Masquerading Train users not to open email attachments or click unknown links (URLs). Such training fosters more secure habits within your organization and will limit many of the risks. .007 Double File Extension Train users to look for double extensions in filenames, and in general use training as a way to bring awareness to common phishing and spearphishing techniques and how to raise suspicion for potentially malicious events. Enterprise T1556 .001 Modify Authentication Process: Domain Controller Authentication Train users to recognize and handle suspicious email attachments. Emphasize the importance of caution when opening attachments from unknown or unexpected sources, even if they appear legitimate. Implement email warning banners to alert users about emails originating from outside the organization or containing attachments, reinforcing awareness and helping users identify potential spearphishing attempts. Enterprise T1111 Multi-Factor Authentication Interception Remove smart cards when not in use. Enterprise T1621 Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation Train users to only accept 2FA/MFA requests from login attempts they initiated, to review source location of the login attempt prompting the 2FA/MFA requests, and to report suspicious/unsolicited prompts. Enterprise T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information Ensure that a finite amount of ingress points to a software deployment system exist with restricted access for those required to allow and enable newly deployed software. Enterprise T1003 OS Credential Dumping Limit credential overlap across accounts and systems by training users and administrators not to use the same password for multiple accounts. .001 LSASS Memory Limit credential overlap across accounts and systems by training users and administrators not to use the same password for multiple accounts. .002 Security Account Manager Limit credential overlap across accounts and systems by training users and administrators not to use the same password for multiple accounts. .003 NTDS Limit credential overlap across accounts and systems by training users and administrators not to use the same password for multiple accounts. .004 LSA Secrets Limit credential overlap across accounts and systems by training users and administrators not to use the same password for multiple accounts. .005 Cached Domain Credentials Limit credential overlap across accounts and systems by training users and administrators not to use the same password for multiple accounts. Enterprise T1566 Phishing Users can be trained to identify social engineering techniques and phishing emails. .001 Spearphishing Attachment Users can be trained to identify social engineering techniques and spearphishing emails. .002 Spearphishing Link Users can be trained to identify social engineering techniques and spearphishing emails with malicious links which includes phishing for consent with OAuth 2.0. Additionally, users may perform visual checks of the domains they visit; however, homographs in ASCII and in IDN domains and URL schema obfuscation may render manual checks difficult. Use email warning banners to alert users when emails contain links from external senders, prompting them to exercise caution and reducing the likelihood of falling victim to spearphishing attacks. Phishing training and other cybersecurity training may raise awareness to check URLs before visiting the sites. .003 Spearphishing via Service Users can be trained to identify social engineering techniques and spearphishing messages with malicious links. .004 Spearphishing Voice Users can be trained to identify and report social engineering techniques and spearphishing attempts, while also being suspicious of and verifying the identify of callers.[4] Enterprise T1598 Phishing for Information Users can be trained to identify social engineering techniques and spearphishing attempts. .001 Spearphishing Service Users can be trained to identify social engineering techniques and spearphishing attempts. .002 Spearphishing Attachment Users can be trained to identify social engineering techniques and spearphishing attempts. .003 Spearphishing Link Users can be trained to identify social engineering techniques and spearphishing attempts.

Enterprise T1528 Steal Application Access Token Users need to be trained to not authorize third-party applications they don\u2019t recognize. The user should pay particular attention to the redirect URL: if the URL is a misspelled or convoluted sequence of words related to an expected service or SaaS application, the website is likely trying to spoof a legitimate service. Users should also be cautious about the permissions they are granting to apps. For example, offline access and access to read emails should excite higher suspicions because adversaries can utilize SaaS APIs to discover credentials and other sensitive communications. Enterprise T1539 Steal Web Session Cookie Train users to identify aspects of phishing attempts where they're asked to enter credentials into a site that has the incorrect domain for the application they are logging into. Additionally, train users not to run untrusted JavaScript in their browser, such as by copying and pasting code or dragging and dropping bookmarklets. Enterprise T1221 Template Injection Train users to identify social engineering techniques and spearphishing emails that could be used to deliver malicious documents.
