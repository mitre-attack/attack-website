"content": " Filter Network Traffic Use network appliances to filter ingress or egress traffic and perform protocol-based filtering. Configure software on endpoints to filter network traffic. Perform inline allow/denylisting of network messages based on the application layer (OSI Layer 7) protocol, especially for automation protocols. Application allowlists are beneficial when there are well-defined communication sequences, types, rates, or patterns needed during expected system operations. Application denylists may be needed if all acceptable communication sequences cannot be defined, but instead a set of known malicious uses can be denied (e.g., excessive communication attempts, shutdown messages, invalid commands). Devices performing these functions are often referred to as deep-packet inspection (DPI) firewalls, context-aware firewalls, or firewalls blocking specific automation/SCADA protocol aware firewalls.

Ensure local users, such as operators and engineers, are giving prioritization over remote sessions and have the authority to regain control over a remote session if needed. Prevent remote access sessions (e.g., RDP, VNC) from taking over local sessions, especially those used for ICS control, especially HMIs.

"path": "/mitigations/ics/index.html",
"content": " ICS Mitigations Mitigations represent security concepts and classes of technologies that can be used to prevent a technique or sub-technique from being successfully executed. Mitigations: 52 ID Name Description M0801 Access Management Access Management technologies can be used to enforce authorization polices and decisions, especially when existing field devices do not provided sufficient capabilities to support user identification and authentication. These technologies typically utilize an in-line network device or gateway system to prevent access to unauthenticated users, while also integrating with an authentication service to first verify user credentials. M0936 Account Use Policies Configure features related to account use like login attempt lockouts, specific login times, etc. M0915 Active Directory Configuration Configure Active Directory to prevent use of certain techniques; use security identifier (SID) Filtering, etc. M0949 Antivirus/Antimalware Use signatures or heuristics to detect malicious software. Within industrial control environments, antivirus/antimalware installations should be limited to assets that are not involved in critical or real-time operations. To minimize the impact to system availability, all products should first be validated within a representative test environment before deployment to production systems. M0913 Application Developer Guidance This mitigation describes any guidance or training given to developers of applications to avoid introducing security weaknesses that an adversary may be able to take advantage of. M0948 Application Isolation and Sandboxing Restrict the execution of code to a virtual environment on or in-transit to an endpoint system. M0947 Audit Perform audits or scans of systems, permissions, insecure software, insecure configurations, etc. to identify potential weaknesses. Perform periodic integrity checks of the device to validate the correctness of the firmware, software, programs, and configurations. Integrity checks, which typically include cryptographic hashes or digital signatures, should be compared to those obtained at known valid states, especially after events like device reboots, program downloads, or program restarts. M0800 Authorization Enforcement The device or system should restrict read, manipulate, or execute privileges to only authenticated users who require access based on approved security policies. Role-based Access Control (RBAC) schemes can help reduce the overhead of assigning permissions to the large number of devices within an ICS. For example, IEC 62351 provides examples of roles used to support common system operations within the electric power sector , while IEEE 1686 defines standard permissions for users of IEDs. M0946 Boot Integrity Use secure methods to boot a system and verify the integrity of the operating system and loading mechanisms. M0945 Code Signing Enforce binary and application integrity with digital signature verification to prevent untrusted code from executing. M0802 Communication Authenticity When communicating over an untrusted network, utilize secure network protocols that both authenticate the message sender and can verify its integrity. This can be done either through message authentication codes (MACs) or digital signatures, to detect spoofed network messages and unauthorized connections. M0953 Data Backup Take and store data backups from end user systems and critical servers. Ensure backup and storage systems are hardened and kept separate from the corporate network to prevent compromise. Maintain and exercise incident response plans , including the management of 'gold-copy' back-up images and configurations for key systems to enable quick recovery and response from adversarial activities that impact control, view, or availability. M0803 Data Loss Prevention Data Loss Prevention (DLP) technologies can be used to help identify adversarial attempts to exfiltrate operational information, such as engineering plans, trade secrets, recipes, intellectual property, or process telemetry. DLP functionality may be built into other security products such as firewalls or standalone suites running on the network and host-based agents. DLP may be configured to prevent the transfer of information through corporate resources such as email, web, and physical media such as USB for host-based solutions. M0942 Disable or Remove Feature or Program Remove or deny access to unnecessary and potentially vulnerable software to prevent abuse by adversaries. M0808 Encrypt Network Traffic Utilize strong cryptographic techniques and protocols to prevent eavesdropping on network communications. M0941 Encrypt Sensitive Information Protect sensitive data-at-rest with strong encryption. M0938 Execution Prevention Block execution of code on a system through application control, and/or script blocking. M0950 Exploit Protection Use capabilities to detect and block conditions that may lead to or be indicative of a software exploit occurring. M0937 Filter Network Traffic Use network appliances to filter ingress or egress traffic and perform protocol-based filtering. Configure software on endpoints to filter network traffic. Perform inline allow/denylisting of network messages based on the application layer (OSI Layer 7) protocol, especially for automation protocols. Application allowlists are beneficial when there are well-defined communication sequences, types, rates, or patterns needed during expected system operations. Application denylists may be needed if all acceptable communication sequences cannot be defined, but instead a set of known malicious uses can be denied (e.g., excessive communication attempts, shutdown messages, invalid commands). Devices performing these functions are often referred to as deep-packet inspection (DPI) firewalls, context-aware firewalls, or firewalls blocking specific automation/SCADA protocol aware firewalls. M0804 Human User Authentication Require user authentication before allowing access to data or accepting commands to a device. While strong multi-factor authentication is preferable, it is not always feasible within ICS environments. Performing strong user authentication also requires additional security controls and processes which are often the target of related adversarial techniques (e.g., Valid Accounts, Default Credentials). Therefore, associated ATT&CK mitigations should be considered in addition to this, including Multi-factor Authentication, Account Use Policies, Password Policies, User Account Management, Privileged Account Management, and User Account Control. M0935 Limit Access to Resource Over Network Prevent access to file shares, remote access to systems, unnecessary services. Mechanisms to limit access may include use of network concentrators, RDP gateways, etc. M0934 Limit Hardware Installation Block users or groups from installing or using unapproved hardware on systems, including USB devices. M0805 Mechanical Protection Layers Utilize a layered protection design based on physical or mechanical protection systems to prevent damage to property, equipment, human safety, or the environment. Examples include interlocks, rupture disk, release values, etc. M0806 Minimize Wireless Signal Propagation Wireless signals frequently propagate outside of organizational boundaries, which provide opportunities for adversaries to monitor or gain unauthorized access to the wireless network. To minimize this threat, organizations should implement measures to detect, understand, and reduce unnecessary RF propagation. M0816 Mitigation Limited or Not Effective This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventative controls since it is based on the abuse of system features. M0932 Multi-factor Authentication Use two or more pieces of evidence to authenticate to a system; such as username and password in addition to a token from a physical smart card or token generator. Within industrial control environments assets such as low-level controllers, workstations, and HMIs have real-time operational control and safety requirements which may restrict the use of multi-factor. M0807 Network Allowlists Network allowlists can be implemented through either host-based files or system hosts files to specify what connections (e.g., IP address, MAC address, port, protocol) can be made from a device. Allowlist techniques that operate at the application layer (e.g., DNP3, Modbus, HTTP) are addressed in Filter Network Traffic mitigation. M0931 Network Intrusion Prevention Use intrusion detection signatures to block traffic at network boundaries. In industrial control environments, network intrusion prevention should be configured so it will not disrupt protocols and communications responsible for real-time functions related to control or safety. M0930 Network Segmentation Architect sections of the network to isolate critical systems, functions, or resources. Use physical and logical segmentation to prevent access to potentially sensitive systems and information. Use a DMZ to contain any internet-facing services that should not be exposed from the internal network. Restrict network access to only required systems and services. In addition, prevent systems from other networks or business functions (e.g., enterprise) from accessing critical process control systems. For example, in IEC 62443, systems within the same secure level should be grouped into a zone, and access to that zone is restricted by a conduit, or mechanism to restrict data flows between zones by segmenting the network. M0928 Operating System Configuration Make configuration changes related to the operating system or a common feature of the operating system that result in system hardening against techniques. M0809 Operational Information Confidentiality Deploy mechanisms to protect the confidentiality of information related to operational processes, facility locations, device configurations, programs, or databases that may have information that can be used to infer organizational trade-secrets, recipes, and other intellectual property (IP). M0810 Out-of-Band Communications Channel Have alternative methods to support communication requirements during communication failures and data integrity attacks. M0927 Password Policies Set and enforce secure password policies for accounts. M0926 Privileged Account Management Manage the creation, modification, use, and permissions associated to privileged accounts, including SYSTEM and root. M0811 Redundancy of Service Redundancy could be provided for both critical ICS devices and services, such as back-up devices or hot-standbys. M0922 Restrict File and Directory Permissions Restrict access by setting directory and file permissions that are not specific to users or privileged accounts. M0944 Restrict Library Loading Prevent abuse of library loading mechanisms in the operating system and software to load untrusted code by configuring appropriate library loading mechanisms and investigating potential vulnerable software. M0924 Restrict Registry Permissions Restrict the ability to modify certain hives or keys in the Windows Registry. M0921 Restrict Web-Based Content Restrict use of certain websites, block downloads/attachments, block Javascript, restrict browser extensions, etc. M0812 Safety Instrumented Systems Utilize Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) to provide an additional layer of protection to hazard scenarios that may cause property damage. A SIS will typically include sensors, logic solvers, and a final control element that can be used to automatically respond to an hazardous condition . Ensure that all SISs are segmented from operational networks to prevent them from being targeted by additional adversarial behavior. M0954 Software Configuration Implement configuration changes to software (other than the operating system) to mitigate security risks associated with how the software operates. M0813 Software Process and Device Authentication Require the authentication of devices and software processes where appropriate. Devices that connect remotely to other systems should require strong authentication to prevent spoofing of communications. Furthermore, software processes should also require authentication when accessing APIs. M0920 SSL/TLS Inspection Break and inspect SSL/TLS sessions to look at encrypted web traffic for adversary activity. M0814 Static Network Configuration Configure hosts and devices to use static network configurations when possible, protocols that require dynamic discovery/addressing (e.g., ARP, DHCP, DNS) can be used to manipulate network message forwarding and enable various AiTM attacks. This mitigation may not always be usable due to limited device features or challenges introduced with different network configurations. M0817 Supply Chain Management Implement a supply chain management program, including policies and procedures to ensure all devices and components originate from a trusted supplier and are tested to verify their integrity. M0919 Threat Intelligence Program A threat intelligence program helps an organization generate their own threat intelligence information and track trends to inform defensive priorities to mitigate risk. M0951 Update Software Perform regular software updates to mitigate exploitation risk. Software updates may need to be scheduled around operational down times. M0918 User Account Management Manage the creation, modification, use, and permissions associated to user accounts. M0917 User Training Train users to be aware of access or manipulation attempts by an adversary to reduce the risk of successful spearphishing, social engineering, and other techniques that involve user interaction. M0818 Validate Program Inputs Devices and programs designed to interact with control system parameters should validate the format and content of all user inputs and actions to ensure the values are within intended operational ranges. These values should be evaluated and further enforced through the program logic running on the field controller. If a problematic or invalid input is identified, the programs should either utilize a predetermined safe value or enter a known safe state, while also logging or alerting on the event. M0916 Vulnerability Scanning Vulnerability scanning is used to find potentially exploitable software vulnerabilities to remediate them. M0815 Watchdog Timers Utilize watchdog timers to ensure devices can quickly detect whether a system is unresponsive. "

"content": " Use Recent OS Version New mobile operating system versions bring not only patches against discovered vulnerabilities but also often bring security architecture improvements that provide resilience against potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses that have not yet been discovered. They may also bring improvements that block use of observed adversary techniques. ID: M1006 Version: 1.0 Created: 25 October 2017 Last Modified: 17 October 2018 Version Permalink Live Version Techniques Addressed by Mitigation Domain ID Name Use Mobile T1626 .001 Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Device Administrator Permissions Changes were introduced in Android 7 to make abuse of device administrator permissions more difficult.[1] Mobile T1638 Adversary-in-the-Middle Recent OS versions have made it more difficult for applications to register as VPN providers. Mobile T1429 Audio Capture Android 9 and above restricts access to microphone, camera, and other sensors from background applications.[2] Mobile T1414 Clipboard Data Android 10 introduced changes to prevent applications from accessing clipboard data if they are not in the foreground or set as the device\u2019s default IME.[3] Mobile T1577 Compromise Application Executable Many vulnerabilities related to injecting code into existing applications have been patched in previous Android releases. Mobile T1641 Data Manipulation Recent OS versions have limited access to certain APIs unless certain conditions are met, making Data Manipulation more difficult .001 Transmitted Data Manipulation Android 10 prevents applications from accessing clipboard data unless the application is on the foreground or is set as the device\u2019s default input method editor (IME).[3] Mobile T1407 Download New Code at Runtime Applications that target Android API level 29 or higher cannot execute native code stored in the application's internal data storage directory, limiting the ability of applications to download and execute native code at runtime. [4] Mobile T1642 Endpoint Denial of Service Android 7 changed how the Device Administrator password APIs function. Mobile T1624 Event Triggered Execution Android 8 introduced additional limitations on the implicit intents that an application can register for.[5] .001 Broadcast Receivers Android 8 introduced additional limitations on the implicit intents that an application can register for.[5] Mobile T1627 Execution Guardrails New OS releases frequently contain additional limitations or controls around device location access. .001 Geofencing New OS releases frequently contain additional limitations or controls around device location access. Mobile T1420 File and Directory Discovery Security architecture improvements in each new version of Android and iOS make it more difficult to escalate privileges. Additionally, newer versions of Android have strengthened the sandboxing applied to applications, restricting their ability to enumerate file system contents. Mobile T1628 .001 Hide Artifacts: Suppress Application Icon Android 10 introduced changes to prevent malicious applications from fully suppressing their icon in the launcher.[6][7] Mobile T1629 .001 Impair Defenses: Prevent Application Removal Recent versions of Android modified how device administrator applications are uninstalled, making it easier for the user to remove them. .002 Impair Defenses: Device Lockout Recent versions of Android modified how device administrator applications are uninstalled, making it easier for the user to remove them. Android 7 introduced updates that revoke standard device administrators\u2019 ability to reset the device\u2019s passcode. Mobile T1417 Input Capture The HIDE_OVERLAY_WINDOWS permission was introduced in Android 12 allowing apps to hide overlay windows of type TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY drawn by other apps with the SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission, preventing other applications from creating overlay windows on top of the current application.[8] .002 GUI Input Capture The HIDE_OVERLAY_WINDOWS permission was introduced in Android 12 allowing apps to hide overlay windows of type TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY drawn by other apps with the SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission, preventing other applications from creating overlay windows on top of the current application.[8] Mobile T1430 Location Tracking On Android 11 and up, users are not prompted with the option to select \"Allow all the time\" and must navigate to the settings page to manually select this option. On iOS 14 and up, users can select whether to provide Precise Location for each installed application. Mobile T1424 Process Discovery Android 7 and later iOS versions introduced changes that prevent applications from performing Process Discovery without elevated privileges. Mobile T1636 Protected User Data OS feature updates often enhance security and privacy around permissions. Mobile T1458 Replication Through Removable Media iOS 11.4.1 and higher introduce USB Restricted Mode, which disables data access through the device's charging port under certain conditions (making the port only usable for power), likely preventing this technique from working.[9] Mobile T1418 Software Discovery Android 11 introduced privacy enhancements to package visibility, filtering results that are returned from the package manager. iOS 12 removed the private API that could previously be used to list installed applications on non-app store applications.[10] .001 Security Software Discovery Android 11 introduced privacy enhancements to package visibility, filtering results that are returned from the package manager. iOS 12 removed the private API that could previously be used to list installed applications on non-app store applications.[10] Mobile T1635 Steal Application Access Token iOS 11 introduced a first-come-first-served principle for URIs, allowing only the prior installed app to be launched via the URI.[11] Android 6 introduced App Links. .001 URI Hijacking iOS 11 introduced a first-come-first-served principle for URIs, allowing only the prior installed app to be launched via the URI.[11] Android 6 introduced App Links. Mobile T1409 Stored Application Data Android 9 introduced a new security policy that prevents applications from reading or writing data to other applications\u2019 internal storage directories, regardless of permissions. Mobile T1632 Subvert Trust Controls Mobile OSes have implemented measures to make it more difficult to trick users into installing untrusted certificates and configurations. iOS 10.3 and higher add an additional step for users to install new trusted CA certificates and configuration profiles. On Android, apps that target compatibility with Android 7 and higher (API Level 24) default to only trusting CA certificates that are bundled with the operating system, not CA certificates that are added by the user or administrator, hence decreasing their susceptibility to successful adversary-in-the-middle attack.[12][13] .001 Code Signing Policy Modification Mobile OSes have implemented measures to make it more difficult to trick users into installing untrusted certificates and configurations. iOS 10.3 and higher add an additional step for users to install new trusted CA certificates and configuration profiles. On Android, apps that target compatibility with Android 7 and higher (API Level 24) default to only trusting CA certificates that are bundled with the operating system, not CA certificates that are added by the user or administrator, hence decreasing their susceptibility to successful adversary-in-the-middle attack.[12][13] Mobile T1422 System Network Configuration Discovery Android 10 introduced changes that prevent normal applications from accessing sensitive device identifiers.[14] Mobile T1512 Video Capture Android 9 and above restricts access to the mic, camera, and other device sensors from applications running in the background. iOS 14 and Android 12 introduced a visual indicator on the status bar (green dot) when an application is accessing the device\u2019s camera.[2] References Adrian Ludwig.

Both policies would mitigate brute-force, guessing, or shoulder surfing of the device passcode. Enterprises can also provision policies to disable biometric authentication, however, biometric authentication can help make using a longer, more complex passcode more practical because it does not need to be entered as frequently. Mobile T1458 Replication Through Removable Media Enterprise policies should prevent enabling USB debugging on Android devices unless specifically needed (e.g., if the device is used for application development).

Consider applying SID Filtering to interforest trusts, such as forest trusts and external trusts, to exclude SID-History from requests to access domain resources. SID Filtering ensures that any authentication requests over a trust only contain SIDs of security principals from the trusted domain (i.e preventing the trusted domain from claiming a user has membership in groups outside of the domain). SID Filtering of forest trusts is enabled by default, but may have been disabled in some cases to allow a child domain to transitively access forest trusts. SID Filtering of external trusts is automatically enabled on all created external trusts using Server 2003 or later domain controllers. [1] [2] However note that SID Filtering is not automatically applied to legacy trusts or may have been deliberately disabled to allow inter-domain access to resources. SID Filtering can be applied by: [3] Disabling SIDHistory on forest trusts using the netdom tool (netdom trust /domain: /EnableSIDHistory:no on the domain controller) Applying SID Filter Quarantining to external trusts using the netdom tool (netdom trust /domain: /quarantine:yes on the domain controller) Applying SID Filtering to domain trusts within a single forest is not recommended as it is an unsupported configuration and can cause breaking changes. [3] [4] If a domain within a forest is untrustworthy then it should not be a member of the forest. In this situation it is necessary to first split the trusted and untrusted domains into separate forests where SID Filtering can be applied to an interforest trust Enterprise T1606 .002 Forge Web Credentials: SAML Tokens For containing the impact of a previously forged SAML token, rotate the token-signing AD FS certificate in rapid succession twice, which will invalidate any tokens generated using the previous certificate.[5] Enterprise T1003 OS Credential Dumping Manage the access control list for \"Replicating Directory Changes\" and other permissions associated with domain controller replication.

Mitigations: 11 ID Name Description M1013 Application Developer Guidance This mitigation describes any guidance or training given to developers of applications to avoid introducing security weaknesses that an adversary may be able to take advantage of. M1002 Attestation Enable remote attestation capabilities when available (such as Android SafetyNet or Samsung Knox TIMA Attestation) and prohibit devices that fail the attestation from accessing enterprise resources. M1010 Deploy Compromised Device Detection Method A variety of methods exist that can be used to enable enterprises to identify compromised (e.g. rooted/jailbroken) devices, whether using security mechanisms built directly into the device, third-party mobile security applications, enterprise mobility management (EMM)/mobile device management (MDM) capabilities, or other methods. Some methods may be trivial to evade while others may be more sophisticated. M1009 Encrypt Network Traffic Application developers should encrypt all of their application network traffic using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to ensure protection of sensitive data and deter network-based attacks. If desired, application developers could perform message-based encryption of data before passing it for TLS encryption. M1012 Enterprise Policy An enterprise mobility management (EMM), also known as mobile device management (MDM), system can be used to provision policies to mobile devices to control aspects of their allowed behavior. M1014 Interconnection Filtering In order to mitigate Signaling System 7 (SS7) exploitation, the Communications, Security, Reliability, and Interoperability Council (CSRIC) describes filtering interconnections between network operators to block inappropriate requests . M1003 Lock Bootloader On devices that provide the capability to unlock the bootloader (hence allowing any operating system code to be flashed onto the device), perform periodic checks to ensure that the bootloader is locked. M1001 Security Updates Install security updates in response to discovered vulnerabilities. M1004 System Partition Integrity Ensure that Android devices being used include and enable the Verified Boot capability, which cryptographically ensures the integrity of the system partition. M1006 Use Recent OS Version New mobile operating system versions bring not only patches against discovered vulnerabilities but also often bring security architecture improvements that provide resilience against potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses that have not yet been discovered. They may also bring improvements that block use of observed adversary techniques. M1011 User Guidance Describes any guidance or training given to users to set particular configuration settings or avoid specific potentially risky behaviors. "
