Likewise, the cyber threat intelligence (CTI) and detection engineering (DE) domains have matured in its principles and outcomes. ATT&CK influences CTI and DE practices by allowing varied cybersecurity teams to communicate tradecraft in a singular language, track and prioritize security threat coverage, and assess threat actor capabilities. However, integrating and maximizing modern ATT&CK use cases in preexisting CTI and DE programs without many resources can be a challenging overhaul. In this presentation, we will discuss the arc of CTI's and DE's evolution due to the prevalence of ATT&CK. We will explore how it can be integrated in cybersecurity programs by providing specific use cases on gap analysis, threat actor prioritization, and blue team tools like VirusTotal and AttackIQ. Finally, we will provide recommendations on building and automating CTI and DE practices that incorporate ATT&CK regardless of resource strain. After attending this talk, attendees will understand how to identify, prioritize, and implement new opportunities to incorporate ATT&CK in CTI and DE programs, impacting the effectiveness of these practices for their respective organizations.",

We know this because we used the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) to categorize more than 1,000 organizations into sectors and analyzed the disparity in ATT&CK technique abuse and threat prevalence between them. In this talk, we will leverage hundreds of petabytes of data from realized threats to describe the nuanced differences in detection data that do exist between organizations in different industries. We will also explain why those differences likely exist, and we will explore explore the factors within organizations that are better predictors of threat exposure than industry or sector alone. By attending this talk, you will gain a better understanding of: - ATT&CK technique and threat trends across the 20 primary NAICS sectors - factors within organizations that play an important role in differentiating the threats they face - how to think about an organization’s industry or sector during the threat modeling process - the predominance of advantageous adversaries in the threat landscape",

In coverage-based assessments, having at least one detection rule for as many techniques as possible is prioritized over the depth or quality of detections. But why is this such a bad idea? To understand the implications of coverage-based assessments, we examine the ATT&CK technique annotations in four major endpoint detection rulesets: Carbon Black, Splunk, Elastic, and Sigma. We find that large regions of the Enterprise ATT&CK Matrix are unimplemented in all rulesets (53 Techniques), in part due to the fact that many techniques are unrealizable as endpoint detection rules. We go on to consider how consistently different rulesets apply technique annotations – even when attempting to detect the same malicious entity, products completely disagree about the appropriate ATT&CK technique annotations 51% of the time, while fully agreeing just 2.7% of the time. Put another way, “covering” one technique may not even suggest protection from the same threat across different products. These findings underscore the dangers of coverage-based ATT&CK assessments.",

By providing a common taxonomy of TTPs, MITRE ATT&CK has allowed for the type of coordination, comparison, and collaboration that over the last decade has made defenders meaningfully better at tracking and stopping adversaries. In the world of cyber insurance, we face a similar problem. We lack common definitions and frameworks. When insurers wish to share data analysis or trends, the signals get confused. What is the difference between a ransomware claim, a phishing claim, and a malware claim? When does BEC involve a compromise versus simple impersonation fraud? These definitions matter when we use this data to inform risk profiles, control investments, insurance pricing, and business decisions. Property insurance doesn't confuse hurricanes and tornadoes, and neither should cyber insurance. In this talk we will outline the framework we've developed at Marsh McLennan to tackle this issue, and how we connect to and integrate MITRE ATT&CK. We hope to illuminate some issues, and provide a path forward to clarify the confusion.",

In today's evolving cybersecurity landscape, enhancing threat detection capabilities is crucial. This presentation introduces the practical application of MITRE CTID’s new Summitting the Pyramid (StP) framework to evaluate and improve threat detection resilience using the ATT&CK framework. The StP framework offers a robust methodology to enhance threat detection analytics by evaluating them against the adversary’s cost to evade. It addresses the common issue where many analytics depend heavily on specific tools or artifacts, making them susceptible to low-cost evasion techniques by adversaries. Our journey with StP will uncover its evolution and key concepts such as core ATT&CK techniques, core procedures, preexisting and TA-brought tools, and ephemeral IOCs. We will engage the audience in a poll on real-world threat detection rule bypass strategies. Applying the StP framework to ATT&CK, we'll demonstrate how to evaluate and improve threat detection rule resilience through case studies from real-world assessments. The session will illustrate how integrating the ATT&CK and StP frameworks creates a comprehensive threat risk map, enhancing the qualitative depth of ATT&CK coverage. Attendees will leave with practical knowledge on applying the StP framework, understanding its value, and integrating it with the ATT&CK framework for a robust threat detection strategy.",

Even if organizations attempt complex automation to generate detection coverage from all security products, the detections are not guaranteed to be accurate and up-to-date. This session addresses the issues mentioned above and presents how to perform continuous execution and validation with a minimal infrastructure via GitHub Actions and Docker containers to create a replicated lab environment where we execute atomic tests using Atomic Red Team, generate and send logs to a centralized logging infrastructure, and continuously validate them against Sigma detections. It also demonstrates the immense value of mapping attacks and detections against the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix and visualizes the results using the ATT&CK Navigator. These visualizations offer valuable insights into the organization's security posture, highlighting any missing detections. Furthermore, this talk will provide insights into the hurdles of utilizing Github Actions and Docker containers for threat hunting.",

Prior work has mainly targeted simple single-core systems focusing on the noisy exploit stages of an attack lifecycle. Such approaches do not scale to modern embedded multi-core platforms running parallel workloads. Detection performance is further exacerbated against inherently stealthy or deliberately evasive attack lifecycles. In this talk, we propose a novel lifecycle-aware power-based malware detector to defend complex multi-core embedded systems against evasive and non-evasive attack lifecycles. We briefly describe an ensemble of state-specific one-class detectors that are trained on different benign operating states and then combined to scale to complex benign scenarios. Next, we introduce the key realization that real-world attacks require a lifecycle of multiple stages to prime the attack, execute it, and perform post-exploit actions. By augmenting the ensemble detector with a lifecycle-aware hidden Markov model that captures general attack lifecycles, we greatly improve detection performance. We test our detector against attack lifecycles formed according to the MITRE ATT&CK matrix using various microarchitecture, software, and network actions and show our lifecycle-aware detector’s strong performance against attack lifecycles that have evaded traditional detectors.",

We will also briefly give examples of how this system can be used to judge the strength of a detection rule in a manner similar to MITRE Engenuity’s “Submitting The Pyramid”. We will finally end the presentation with examples of how this framework can be used for Threat Modeling, especially with broader Techniques. At the conference, we intend to release a mapping of as many Techniques as we can to this Ontology framework as well as a list of “Environment-dependent Entities” for use in Threat Modeling.",

By emulating threat actor tactics in a simulated hybrid cloud environment, a joint team of incident responders and data scientists was able to discern strengths and deficiencies in cloud data sources and formulate detection logic for malicious behaviors. These outcomes were achieved by systematically mapping red team activities to ATT&CK and tracking blue team coverage using a purple team campaign management capability. As a result, cloud visibility gaps are being closed and ATT&CK-annotated detection rules operationalized to accelerate threat detection on critical networks.",

The specific technique for “Collection” is “Data from an information repository”. Since databases are one of the two primary methods of storing data (in a database or a file), this tactic/technique should be considered more closely. Data does not exist in a vacuum. It is accessed/managed by applications in order to be useful. A key target of a hacker who wants to steal data is a database. There are many ways to collect such data – eavesdropping/man in the middle attacks of data in transit, capturing data at the point of collection (such as point of sale devices), exfiltrating files which contain sensitive data, etc. But the mother lode is the database. By watching how and what data is accessed from a database (as an “authorized” user) it is possible to determine whether such access constitutes an attempted data theft. This is the equivalent of catching a bank robber in the vault.",

Despite the benefit of having a central language, ATT&CK offers different levels of detail that might be useful for one team but not others. This paper points out some of these differences in the level of details available in ATT&CK, especially from the point of view of Detection Engineers, and focused on detection coverage.<br><br>In summary, while ATT&CK does not define the Procedure level of the TTP trinity, it is still useful to define the “Degrees of Freedom” an attacker has within a technique. Some techniques only have a limited number of possible Procedures, some techniques might have more, and others might be so open ended that they offer an unlimited number of possible procedures per technique. We examine this concept on both the Technique and Tactic levels and make the argument that techniques that have a high number of possible Procedures cannot be covered by Detection Engineers.<br><br>At the conference, we intend to release an ATT&CK Navigator layer to help Detection Engineers quickly filter out which Tactics and Techniques they need to focus on and which ones they simply cannot cover.",

This process allows us to quickly and easily implement new detection controls, test them across multiple environments, and deploy them in a controlled and consistent manner.<br><br>We will discuss how security teams can reap the benefits of using detection-as-code, and how this can help achieving a single source of truth for their detection logic. Adopting this approach enables teams to use automation and unit testing to manage and validate their detection controls across multiple environments and ensure proper documentation. By adopting a detection-as-code approach, teams can gain the confidence that comes from knowing that their detections and mitigations work as intended.",

Turn a Toyota Tercel into a tank, of course.\nThe Interpres Security threat intelligence team found itself in that exact situation. Wanting to leverage the MITRE ATT&CK catalog in creating a comprehensive and timely threat intelligence repository, the Interpres team built a series of tools, processes, and paradigms that we call Intelligence Engineering. In this talk, we’ll examine how we combined ATT&CK, STIX2, the Vertex Project’s open-source intelligence platform, Synapse, and custom code to deliver meaningful, rapid, verifiable intelligence to our customers. We’ll share lessons learned on automation, how to run multiple ATT&CK libraries side-by-side, and making programmatic intelligence delivery scalable and effective – just like building a tank out of an imported sedan.",

Over the last seven years, a variety of use cases has been explored with different measures of success. In this presentation, Gert-Jan will explore applying the ATT&CK framework in scenario-based defense. When adopting a scenario approach, security teams collaborate to fuse their understanding of certain situations into scenarios. For example, addressing different hypotheses that can be explained to leadership and specialist teams alike. This approach requires more than \"just\" breaking down everything into tactics, techniques, and procedures. Some stakeholders might not understand that. For example, some might want to tell a good story about adversaries while others want to translate their understanding of intrusions into a sequential pattern. The objective of this talk is to explore how the granularity of the framework supports creation of scenarios, the limitations in the current approach to ATT&CK when building scenarios across different stakeholders, and addressing potential areas the \"language of ATT&CK\" can evolve towards over the next 5 years.",

A wealth of open-sourced, ATT&CK-mapped resources now exists, giving security teams greater access to both detections and red team tests they can implement, but intelligence (also aligned with ATT&CK), is essential to provide necessary context to ensure that detection efforts are focused effectively.<br>This session will discuss a new approach to the prioritization challenge, starting with an analysis of the current defensive landscape, as measured by ATT&CK coverage for more than a dozen detection repositories and technologies, and guidance on sourcing TTP intelligence. The team will then show how real-world defensive strategies can be strengthened by encompassing a full-spectrum view of threat detection, including the implementation of YARA, Sigma, and Snort in security appliances. Critically, alignment of both intelligence and defenses with ATT&CK enables defenders to move the focus of detection efforts to indications of malicious behavior before the final payload is deployed, where controls are most effective at preventing serious damage to the organization.",

Enter the Jupyter notebook, an open-source computational notebook that researchers use to combine code, computing output, text, and media into a single interface. In this talk, we share three stories of how organizations use Jupyter notebooks to align ATT&CK-based attack flows to the security program, generating data about detection and prevention failures, defensive gaps, and longitudinal performance. By using Jupyter notebooks in this way, teams can better leverage ATT&CK for security effectiveness. It becomes less of a bingo card and more of a strategic tool for understanding the health of the program against big tactics (I.e., lateral movement), defensive gaps (I.e., micro-segmentation), and the team's performance.",

In this presentation experts from Siemplify propose the problem be looked at like an orchestra with its dozens of instrument types. Without a conductor to guide each section there would only be noise, but with the conductor leading, beautiful symphonies can now be played. The Siemplify team plan to show how a SOAR platform can be that conductor using the ATT&CK framework as its sheet music, and turn the constant noise into a threat intel driven security program.",

What is not awesome is dissecting a piece of prose for all of the specific embedded ATT&CK technique IDs and then mapping them to your detections to determine coverage.

Join the Splunk team as they tell the world about ATT&CK Detections Collector (ADC). ADC is an open-source python tool that will allow you to extract MITRE technique IDs from a third-party URLs and output them into a file.

In the intervening years, they’ve relied on the framework to develop open source tools like Atomic Red Team and help security teams prioritize their defensive efforts with blogs and our annual Threat Detection Report. </p><p>In early 2020, MITRE announced that ATT&CK would be expanding its original taxonomy of tactics and techniques to include sub-techniques. In the months that followed MITRE's announcement, Red Canary’s research, intelligence, and detection engineering teams painstakingly remapped their library of thousands of behavioral analytics to sub-techniques. In doing so, they improved their correlational logic, experimented with the idea of conditional technique mapping, and, unfortunately, rendered the 2020 Threat Detection Report out-of-date. </p><p>In this talk from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session on October 9, 2020, Brian discusses how refactoring for sub-techniques offered us the opportunity to apply all the lessons learned in more than two years of operationalizing ATT&CK. He also explores how Red Canary has remodeled its ATT&CK mapping to allow for added flexibility and human input and shows what happens when the Red Canary applied their new sub-technique mappings to the 2020 Threat Detection Report.</p>",

Specifically, Rege and Bleiman demonstrate the mapping of the PRE-ATT&CK matrix to social engineering case studies as an experiential learning project in an upper-level cybercrime liberal arts course. It thus allows students to understand the alignment process of threat intelligence to the PRE-ATT&CK framework and also learn about its usefulness/limitations. The talk also discusses the mapping of the ATT&CK matrix, tactics, techniques, software, and groups for two cybercrime datasets created by collating publicly disclosed incidents: (i) critical infrastructure ransomware (CIRW) incidents, and (ii) social engineering (SE) incidents. For the CIRW dataset, 39% of the strains mapped onto the ATT&CK software. For the SE dataset, 49% of the groups and 65% of the techniques map on to the MITRE framework. This helps the researchers identify the framework's usefulness/limitations and also helps our datasets connect to richer information that may not otherwise be available in the publicly disclosed incidents.",

However, emulating adversary TTPs on production environments is often very limited in testing scope and frequency, and such practice may cause unwanted business disruption. In this talk from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session on October 9, 2020, Hart presents a different approach to testing controls against ATT&CK. He demonstrates how it is possible to provide data-based methods to evaluate the exploitability of ATT&CK techniques by gathering information from the network, endpoint, and services; this unique approach does not emulate any sort of malicious action, thus reducing the potential of causing business disruption to the minimum. Hart also outlines a new open-source guideline based on ATT&CK mitigations, that security teams can use to assess their security posture non-intrusively and at scale.",

Usually, you would count the frequency of the activity and if this number exceeds a pre-defined threshold then you would consider it abnormal/attack. The problem here is the definition of this threshold (and the reduction of false positives and negatives). Some practitioners set this threshold to 5, others to 10, and in some situations, to 30 or even higher. The remaining question is how to obtain a statistically sounding threshold? In this talk from the MITRE ATT&CKcon Power Hour session on October 9, 2020, Jair Santanna answers this question by using a half-century-old statistical method to define such a dynamic threshold (John Tukey’s \"honestly significant difference\"-HSD). Northwave has implemented this method in a production environment over several ATT&CK techniques using the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) from Microsoft, Azure Sentinel. Northwave’s scripts are publicly available. In this presentation, Santanna sheds light on dynamic thresholds for security monitoring and discuss how to move forward with this challenging old problem.",

Much can be learned from looking at historical attack data, but how can we piece all this information together to identify new relationships between threats and attacks?

One lesson learned is that it is not just about merely mapping out attacks and techniques used into graphs, but the strength lies in applying different algorithms to answer specific questions.

One approach might be reading the data sources metadata available per each technique in the ATT&CK framework. That is a good first step, and it is already helping organizations to integrate the framework with their current security controls. However, as you go deeper into the specific recommended data sources per technique, it is very important to understand that not every technique variation requires the same data sources. In addition, there needs to be a way to validate if what we are collecting aligns with the data analytics being created. In this talk, we will share our current experiences contributing to the \"Data Sources\" section of ATT&CK framework and the Cyber Analytics Repository (CAR) project. We will show how to use pre-captured datasets from our open source project named Mordor to expedite simulation of adversarial techniques and validation of data analytics. In addition, we will show how we leverage Jupyter Notebooks to develop and test data analytics from projects like CAR to finish the validation process and provide recommendations.",

VERIS has been the base analysis framework for supporting the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) since its inception. However, as organizations work to interpret the richness of information present on the DBIR to a more tactical level, the Threat Action Varieties available on VERIS fail to capture the detail present on the incidents recorded. This talk presents the Verizon Common Attack Framework (VCAF), an effort from the Security Data Science team and the DBIR team in Verizon to expand and map the ATT&CK framework in alignment with the DBIR Threat Action Varieties to provide this much-sought level of granularity in recording and analyzing recorded breaches. Additionally, this talk describes possible outcomes when this data is available and organized as such. Examples include applying DBIR-inspired attack vector analytics upon ATT&CK layer information, effectively identifying optimal control choke points on the attack graphs according to specific industries covered by the DBIR.",

When the Blue Team is able to connect the dots from offensive activities in the network and what they see in their logs, rewalls, SIEMs, etc. they have the ability to fully understand what adversaries do and what the TTP’s of attackers actually look like if they are active in their network.

The research presented in this talk seeks to develop a framework which adapts the existing MITRE ATT&CK framework to look at attacks in a less linear, more human-centered framework that focuses on the capabilities and decisions of the threat actor. The framework approaches threat analysis from a binary assessment of success vs. failure in order to see the entire attack and consider the potential for a number of methods and attempts made in a single attack. A detailed methodology and sample charts are included for a reference and a starting point in developing one’s own personalized charts, and recommendations are made for ways to integrate this methodology into the risk management process.",

            "description": "With the development of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and its categorization of adversary activity during the attack cycle, understanding what to hunt for has become easier and more efficient than ever. However, organizations are still struggling to understand how they can prioritize the development of hunt hypothesis, assess their current security posture, and develop the right analytics with the help of ATT&CK. Even though there are several ways to utilize ATT&CK to accomplish those goals, there are only a few that are focusing primarily on the data that is currently being collected to drive the success of a hunt program. This presentation shows how organizations can benefit from mapping their current visibility from a data perspective to the ATT&CK framework. It focuses on how to identify, document, standardize and model current available data to enhance a hunt program. It presents an updated ThreatHunter-Playbook, a Kibana ATT&CK dashboard, a new project named Open Source Security Events Metadata known as OSSEM and expands on the “data sources” section already provided by ATT&CK on most of the documented adversarial techniques.",

            "description": "The security community is quickly adopting the MITRE ATT&CK matrix as a framework for understanding and analyzing targeted intrusions. However, one of its potential limitations is a lack of detailed historical intrusion data for developing accurate and thorough ATT&CK-based threat modeling. Crowdstrike’s Falcon OverWatch threat hunting team analyzes adversary behavior on a regular basis. The amount of OverWatch's malicious intrusion data is significant given the valuable telemetry delivered by Falcon's endpoint technology. As a result, CrowdStrike has amassed a rich data library of malicious activity that can be applied to the ATT&CK model. The OverWatch Strategic Counter-Adversary Research (SCAR) team has now evaluated all OverWatch intrusion data since January 1, 2018 through the lens of the ATT&CK framework. This presentation presents these findings and highlights cases of unique adversary TTP use. The results of this analysis will provide a baseline from which CrowdStrike can better identify changes in threat actor TTP trends moving forward. In addition, the presentation discusses limitations in this type of research.",

One of these adversaries, known as Sofacy, has been carrying out attack campaigns on high profile targets for many years and has continued into 2018. To understand how to defend against these threats, an analyst has to read our reports, process them and mentally map them to their defenses. In most cases we expect readers just \"block\" all of the indicators we include in the report and assume they are covered. Last year we started using ATT&CK to codify the techniques we observed, linking those techniques to indicator patterns and encoding them into STIX 2 objects, with the goal of creating something that a defender can use to answer the question: \"How am I defending against this adversary?\" We call these documents, \"Adversary Playbooks\" as they contain our best approximation of how the adversary launches their attacks. This talk describes the concept of Adversary Playbooks, as well as provides an overview of the attack campaigns Unit 42 has attributed to the Sofacy group in 2018. It uses the discussed attacks to show how these playbooks are constructed and explain some of the challenges of incorporating ATT&CK and STIX 2 together for this purpose.",
