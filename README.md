# MITRE ATT&CK&reg; Website

### See the live site at [attack.mitre.org](https://attack.mitre.org)!

This repository contains the source code used to generate the MITRE ATT&CK&reg; website as seen at `attack.mitre.org`. The source code is flexible to allow users to generate the site with custom content.

## Usage
The [Install and Run](#Install-and-Build) section below explains how to set up a local version of the site. You can also visit the live site at [attack.mitre.org](https://attack.mitre.org). See [Building the site with custom content](#Building-the-site-with-custom-content) for information about building the site with custom content.

Use our [Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-website/issues) to let us know of any bugs or other issues you encounter. We also encourage pull requests if you've extended the site in a cool way and want to share back to the community!

If you find errors or typos in the site content, please let us know by sending an email to attack@mitre.org with the subject **Website Content Error**, and make sure to include both a description of the error and the URL at which it can be found. 

_See [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on making contributions to the ATT&CK website._

## Requirements

- [python](https://www.python.org/) 3.6 or greater

## Install and Build

### Install requirements

1. Create a virtual environment: 
    - macOS and Linux: `python3 -m venv env`
    - Windows: `py -m venv env`
2. Activate the virtual environment: 
    - macOS and Linux: `source env/bin/activate`
    - Windows: `env/Scripts/activate.bat`
3. Install requirement packages: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

### Build and serve the local site

1. Update ATT&CK markdown from the STIX content, and generate the output html from the markdown: `python3 update-attack.py -c -b`. _Note: `update-attack.py`, has many optional command line arguments which affect the behavior of the build. Run `python3 update-attack.py -h` for a list of arguments and an explanation of their functionality._
2. Serve the html to `localhost:8000`: 
    1. `cd output`
    2. `python3 -m pelican.server`

### Installing, building and serving the site via Docker 

1. Build the docker image:
    - `docker build -t <your_preferred_image_name> .`
2. Run a docker container:
    - `docker run --name <your_preferred_container_name -d -p <your_preferred_port>:80 <image_name_from_build_command>`
3. View the site on your preferred localhost port

## Implementation Overview

The ATT&CK site uses a combination of Python, Pelican and Jinja to convert the STIX content into a set of static HTML files. When `update-attack.py` is run, it generates a set of markdown files in `content` containing the parsed STIX content. Pelican then reads these markdown files and uses them to with the Jinja templates in `attack-theme/templates` to build the site HTML in the output directory. 

## Building the site with custom content

The ATT&CK Website is designed support an evolving knowledge base. The content seen on the site is generated from data in STIX2.0 JSON format. The data used on the live site at [attack.mitre.org](https://attack.mitre.org) can be found on our [mitre/cti](https://github.com/mitre/cti) github repo. 

You can generate the website using custom content by replacing the STIX bundles in `/data/stix/`:
- `enterprise-attack.json` is the bundle for the enterprise domain.
- `mobile-attack.json` is the bundle for the mobile domain.
- `pre-attack.json` is the bundle for the pre-attack domain.
- the `*_old.json` bundles are updated automatically when the site is built, and are used for generating Matrix timestamps. `old_dates.json` is used for fallback timestamps for the matrices. You typically won't need to replace these files.

Users wishing to make changes to the ATT&CK website visual theme should take a look at our scss source files in `attack-theme/static/style`. Changes to the colors defined in `_colors.scss` should automatically propagate across the site. Users wishing to make changes to the layout of pages should modify the templates found in `attack-theme/templates`. Major additions or changes will typically require modification of the python modules in `modules/` in addition to the templates.

The logos used in the header, footer, and on the landing page of the website can be easily changed. Simply find their keys in the `settings_dict` of `modules/config.py`, and update their values to point to the new images.

#### ATT&CK Navigator
The ATT&CK Navigator is an open-source tool providing basic navigation and annotation of ATT&CK matrices, something that people are already doing today in tools like Excel. It is designed to be simple and generic - you can use the Navigator to visualize your defensive coverage, your red/blue team planning, the frequency of detected techniques, and more.

#### STIX
Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX<sup>&trade;</sup>) is a language and serialization format used to exchange cyber threat intelligence (CTI).

STIX enables organizations to share CTI with one another in a consistent and machine readable manner, allowing security communities to better understand what computer-based attacks they are most likely to see and to anticipate and/or respond to those attacks faster and more effectively.

STIX is designed to improve many different capabilities, such as collaborative threat analysis, automated threat exchange, automated detection and response, and more.
