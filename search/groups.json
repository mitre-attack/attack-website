"content": " Groups Groups are activity clusters that are tracked by a common name in the security community. Analysts track these clusters using various analytic methodologies and terms such as threat groups, activity groups, and threat actors. Some groups have multiple names associated with similar activities due to various organizations tracking similar activities by different names. Organizations' group definitions may partially overlap with groups designated by other organizations and may disagree on specific activity. For the purposes of the Group pages, the MITRE ATT&CK team uses the term Group to refer to any of the above designations for an adversary activity cluster. The team makes a best effort to track overlaps between names based on publicly reported associations, which are designated as \u201cAssociated Groups\u201d on each page (formerly labeled \u201cAliases\u201d), because we believe these overlaps are useful for analyst awareness. We do not represent these names as exact overlaps and encourage analysts to do additional research. Groups are mapped to publicly reported technique use and original references are included. The information provided does not represent all possible technique use by Groups, but rather a subset that is available solely through open source reporting. Groups are also mapped to reported Software used and attributed Campaigns, and related techniques for each are tracked separately on their respective pages.

The group initially focused on targeting South Korean government entities, think tanks, and individuals identified as experts in various fields, and expanded its operations to include the United States, Russia, Europe, and the UN. Kimsuky has focused its intelligence collection activities on foreign policy and national security issues related to the Korean peninsula, nuclear policy, and sanctions.[1][2][3][4][5] Kimsuky was assessed to be responsible for the 2014 Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co. compromise; other notable campaigns include Operation STOLEN PENCIL (2018), Operation Kabar Cobra (2019), and Operation Smoke Screen (2019).[6][7][8] North Korean group definitions are known to have significant overlap, and some security researchers report all North Korean state-sponsored cyber activity under the name Lazarus Group instead of tracking clusters or subgroups.

"content": " Lazarus Group Lazarus Group is a North Korean state-sponsored cyber threat group that has been attributed to the Reconnaissance General Bureau.[1][2] The group has been active since at least 2009 and was reportedly responsible for the November 2014 destructive wiper attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment as part of a campaign named Operation Blockbuster by Novetta. Malware used by Lazarus Group correlates to other reported campaigns, including Operation Flame, Operation 1Mission, Operation Troy, DarkSeoul, and Ten Days of Rain. [3] North Korean group definitions are known to have significant overlap, and some security researchers report all North Korean state-sponsored cyber activity under the name Lazarus Group instead of tracking clusters or subgroups, such as Andariel, APT37, APT38, and Kimsuky.

"content": " FIN7 FIN7 is a financially-motivated threat group that has been active since 2013. FIN7 has primarily targeted the retail, restaurant, hospitality, software, consulting, financial services, medical equipment, cloud services, media, food and beverage, transportation, and utilities industries in the U.S. A portion of FIN7 was run out of a front company called Combi Security and often used point-of-sale malware for targeting efforts. Since 2020, FIN7 shifted operations to a big game hunting (BGH) approach including use of REvil ransomware and their own Ransomware as a Service (RaaS), Darkside. FIN7 may be linked to the Carbanak Group, but there appears to be several groups using Carbanak malware and are therefore tracked separately.[1][2][3][4][5][6] ID: G0046 \u24d8 Associated Groups: GOLD
