Analytics: 2032 ID Platform Domain Enterprise Mobile ICS Detection Strategy Description AN0001 IaaS Enterprise DET0001 Detects access attempts to cloud instance metadata endpoints (e.g., 169.254.169.254) from virtual machines or containerized workloads. This includes both direct access and SSRF exploitation patterns. AN0002 Windows Enterprise DET0002 Detects non-standard processes (e.g., PowerShell, python.exe, rundll32.exe) making outbound connections using publish/subscribe protocols (e.g., MQTT, AMQP) over non-browser, encrypted channels, often beaconing to message brokers. AN0003 Linux Enterprise DET0002 Detects CLI tools (e.g., mosquitto_pub, nc, python scripts) interacting with pub/sub brokers using unusual topic names, high-frequency publication rates, or obfuscated payloads to non-standard hosts. AN0004 macOS Enterprise DET0002 Detects osascript, curl, or custom binaries interacting with XMPP/MQTT brokers in unapproved destinations with encrypted payloads or frequent POST-like requests to broker URIs. AN0005 Network Devices Enterprise DET0002 Detects pub/sub traffic over unusual ports, high-frequency topic publications, and connections to known-bad or dynamic broker endpoints outside allowlisted infrastructure. AN0006 Windows Enterprise DET0003 Adversary uses built-in tools such as 'net user /add /domain' or PowerShell to create a domain user account. The behavior chain includes: (1) suspicious process execution on a domain controller followed by (2) user account creation event (Event ID 4720) on the same host. AN0007 Linux Enterprise DET0003 Adversary with access to domain management tools (e.g., realmd, samba-tool, ldapmodify) creates a new domain user via command-line utilities. Behavior chain: LDAP command or script triggers \u2192 user entry added in AD via Kerberos/LDAP traffic. AN0008 macOS Enterprise DET0003 macOS clients joined to AD via LDAP may script account provisioning via dsconfigad, dscl, or LDAP scripts. Detection occurs when such tools run on a domain-joined system, followed by authentication attempts by a previously unseen account. AN0009 Windows Enterprise DET0004 Abnormal modification of the PATH environment variable or registry keys controlling system paths, combined with execution of binaries named after legitimate system tools from user-writable directories. Defender correlates registry modifications, file creation of suspicious binaries, and process execution paths inconsistent with baseline system directories. AN0010 Linux Enterprise DET0004 User modification of the $PATH environment variable in shell configuration files or direct runtime PATH changes, followed by execution of binaries from user-controlled directories. Defender observes file edits to ~/.bashrc, ~/.profile, or /etc/paths.d and process execution resolving to unexpected binary locations. AN0011 macOS Enterprise DET0004 Modification of PATH or HOME environment variables through shell config files, launchctl, or /etc/paths.d entries, combined with process execution from attacker-controlled directories. Defender correlates file changes in /etc/paths.d with process execution resolving to malicious binaries. AN0012 Windows Enterprise DET0005 Execution of binaries where the on-disk filename does not match PE metadata such as OriginalFilename or InternalName. Often observed with renamed LOLBAS or system binaries like rundll32, powershell, or psexec. AN0013 macOS Enterprise DET0005 Execution of renamed or relocated native macOS utilities with uncommon names or non-default paths (e.g., renamed osascript, bash, or curl). AN0014 Linux Enterprise DET0005 Execution of renamed common utilities (e.g., bash, nc, python, sh) from atypical directories or with names intended to deceive defenders or EDRs. AN0015 Network Devices Enterprise DET0006 From a defender\u2019s perspective, suspicious bridging is observed when network devices begin allowing traffic that contradicts existing segmentation or access policies. Observable behaviors include sudden modifications to ACLs or firewall rules, unusual cross-boundary traffic flows (e.g., east-west communications across separated VLANs), or simultaneous ingress/egress anomalies. Multi-event correlation is key: configuration changes on a router/firewall followed by unexpected traffic patterns, especially from unusual sources, is a strong indicator of compromise. AN0016 Windows Enterprise DET0007 Adversary uses nltest, PowerShell, or Win32/.NET API to enumerate domain trust relationships (via DSEnumerateDomainTrusts, GetAllTrustRelationships, or LDAP queries), followed by discovery or authentication staging. AN0017 IaaS Enterprise DET0008 Cloud login from atypical geolocation or user-agent string, followed by resource enumeration or infrastructure manipulation using cloud CLI/API AN0018 Identity Provider Enterprise DET0008 Federated login using SSO or OAuth grant to cloud control plane, followed by directory or permissions enumeration AN0019 Office Suite Enterprise DET0008 Login to M365 or Google Workspace from CLI tools or unexpected source IPs, followed by mailbox or document access AN0020 SaaS Enterprise DET0008 Remote access to third-party SaaS with OAuth or API tokens post-initial compromise, followed by sensitive data access or configuration changes AN0021 Windows Enterprise DET0009 Adversary manipulates dependencies/dev tools used by developers or CI: a package manager (npm/yarn/pnpm, pip/pipenv, nuget/dotnet, chocolatey/winget, maven/gradle) or a compiler/IDE downloads or restores content; files are written under project paths and execution paths (node_modules, packages, .nuget, .gradle, .m2, %AppData%\\npm, %UserProfile%.cargo\\bin, temp build dirs). First run of newly written components triggers scripts (preinstall/postinstall), shell/PowerShell spawning, or loader DLLs, followed by network egress to non-approved registries/CDNs. AN0022 Linux Enterprise DET0009 Developer or CI invokes package managers/compilers (apt/yum + build-essential, npm/yarn/pnpm, pip/pip3, gem, cargo, go, maven/gradle). These write executable or script files into PATH or project dirs and immediately execute embedded lifecycle hooks (preinstall/postinstall, setup.py, npm scripts) that spawn shells or curl/wget, followed by egress to unfamiliar registries or domains. AN0023 macOS Enterprise DET0009 Developer tools (Homebrew, pip, npm/yarn, Xcode builds) install or update dependencies; new Mach-O or scripts appear under /usr/local, /opt/homebrew, ~/Library/Application Support, project dirs (node_modules/.bin, venv/bin). First run spawns sh/zsh/osascript/curl and new outbound flows; Gatekeeper/AMFI may flag unsigned components. AN0024 Windows Enterprise DET0010 Correlates unexpected modifications to WMI event filters, scheduled task triggers, or registry autorun keys with subsequent execution of non-standard binaries by SYSTEM-level processes. AN0025 Linux Enterprise DET0010 Detects inotify or auditd configuration changes that monitor system files coupled with execution of script interpreters or binaries by cron or systemd timers. AN0026 macOS Enterprise DET0010 Correlates launchd plist modifications with subsequent unauthorized script execution or anomalous parent-child process trees involving user agents. AN0027 IaaS Enterprise DET0010 Monitors cloud function creation triggered by specific audit log events (e.g., IAM changes, object creation), followed by anomalous behavior from new service accounts. AN0028 SaaS Enterprise DET0010 Correlates Power Automate or similar logic app workflows triggered by SaaS file uploads or email rules with data forwarding or anomalous access patterns. AN0029 Office Suite Enterprise DET0010 Detects macros or VBA triggers set to execute on document open or close events, often correlating with embedded payloads or C2 traffic shortly after execution. AN0030 Windows Enterprise DET0011 Processes generating large outbound connections with disproportionate send/receive ratios, often to uncommon ports or hosts, potentially inserting meaningless data into protocol payloads. AN0031 Linux Enterprise DET0011 Outbound traffic with anomalous payload sizes and patterns from non-networking processes, often observed via packet inspection or connection logs. AN0032 macOS Enterprise DET0011 Previously unseen applications generating outbound connections with atypical data flow characteristics, such as excessive data with no return response. AN0033 ESXi Enterprise DET0011 Anomalous traffic from ESXi host management daemons (like hostd or vpxa) embedding non-standard payloads in management protocols (e.g., HTTPS) or beaconing behavior. AN0034 Windows Enterprise DET0012 Discrepancies between VBA source code and p-code inside Office documents. Defender perspective: anomalies in file metadata streams, execution of Office processes loading macros without source code consistency, and script execution with no corresponding source metadata. AN0035 Linux Enterprise DET0012 Execution of Wine or LibreOffice macros with inconsistent VBA metadata. Defender perspective: file analysis showing p-code embedded without matching source streams. AN0036 macOS Enterprise DET0012 Opening of Office files where VBA source code appears benign or missing, but p-code remains active. Defender perspective: process execution of Office apps with macro execution lacking visible source components. AN0037 Windows Enterprise DET0013 Access to browser artifact locations (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Firefox) by processes like PowerShell, cmd.exe, or unknown tools, followed by file reads, decoding, or export operations indicating enumeration of bookmarks, autofill, or history databases. AN0038 Linux Enterprise DET0013 Unauthorized shell or script-based access to browser config or SQLite history files, typically in ~/.config/google-chrome/, ~/.mozilla/, or ~/.var/app folders, indicating enumeration of bookmarks or saved credentials. AN0039 macOS Enterprise DET0013 Scripting or CLI tool access to ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome or ~/Library/Safari bookmarks, cookies, or history databases. Detection relies on unexpected processes accessing or reading from these locations. AN0040 Windows Enterprise DET0014 Detects staging of sensitive files into temporary or public directories, compression with 7zip/WinRAR, or batch copy prior to exfiltration. AN0041 Linux Enterprise DET0014 Detects script or user activity copying files to a central temp or /mnt directory followed by archive/compression utilities. AN0042 macOS Enterprise DET0014 Detects files collected into user temp or shared directories followed by compression with ditto, zip, or custom scripts. AN0043 IaaS Enterprise DET0014 Detects virtual disk expansion or file copy operations to cloud buckets or mounted volumes from isolated instances. AN0044 ESXi Enterprise DET0014 Detects snapshots or data stored in VMFS volumes from root CLI or remote agents. AN0045 Windows Enterprise DET0015 Detects unusual command executions and service modifications that indicate self-patching or disabling of vulnerable services post-compromise. Defenders should monitor for service stop commands, suspicious process termination, and execution of binaries or scripts aligned with known patching or service management tools outside of expected admin contexts. AN0046 Linux Enterprise DET0015 Detects adversary attempts to monopolize control of compromised systems by issuing service stop commands, unloading vulnerable modules, or forcefully killing competing processes. Defenders should monitor audit logs and syslog for administrative utilities (systemctl, service, kill) being invoked outside of normal change management. AN0047 macOS Enterprise DET0015 Detects unauthorized termination of system daemons or commands issued through launchctl or kill to stop competing services or malware processes. Defenders should monitor unified logs and EDR telemetry for unusual service modifications or terminations. AN0048 Windows Enterprise DET0016 Adversary executes commands to enumerate installed antivirus, EDR, or firewall agents using WMI, registry queries, and built-in tools (e.g., tasklist, netsh, sc query). Correlated with elevated process privileges or scripting engine usage. AN0049 Linux Enterprise DET0016 Adversary runs discovery commands such as ps aux, systemctl status, or cat /etc/init.d/ to enumerate security software or services. Often occurs alongside privilege escalation or bash script execution. AN0050 macOS Enterprise DET0016 Adversary attempts to detect monitoring agents such as Little Snitch, KnockKnock, or other system daemons via process listing (ps -e), application folder checks, and system extension listing. AN0051 Windows Enterprise DET0017 Correlated modification of AppCompat registry keys and execution of sdbinst.exe to install custom shim databases. Followed by DLL injection via shim behavior into target application processes. AN0052 Windows Enterprise DET0018 A process (often LOLBin or user-launched program) loads a DLL from a user-writable/UNC/Temp path or unsigned/invalid signer. Within a short window the DLL is (a) newly written to disk, (b) spawned as follow-on execution (rundll32/regsvr32), or (c) establishes outbound C2. AN0053 Linux Enterprise DET0018 A process loads a shared object (.so) via dlopen/LD_PRELOAD/open from non-standard or temporary locations (e.g., /tmp, /dev/shm), especially shortly after that .so is written or fetched, or linked via manipulated environment variables (LD_PRELOAD/LD_LIBRARY_PATH). AN0054 macOS Enterprise DET0018 A process loads a non-system .dylib/.so via dyld (dlopen/dlsym) from user-writable locations (~/Library, /tmp) or after the library was recently created/downloaded, often followed by network egress or persistence. AN0055 Windows Enterprise DET0019 Executable or script payloads lacking symbol information and readable strings that are created or dropped by unusual or short-lived processes. AN0056 Linux Enterprise DET0019 Executable or binary files created without symbol tables or with stripped sections, especially by non-user shell processes or compilers invoked outside standard dev paths. AN0057 macOS Enterprise DET0019 Creation of run-only AppleScripts or Mach-O binaries lacking symbol table and string references, especially when dropped by user space scripting engines or staging apps. AN0058 Network Devices Enterprise DET0019 Inbound binary payloads transferred over HTTP/S with compressed or encoded headers, lacking signature markers or metadata indicative of compiler/toolchain. AN0059 Linux Enterprise DET0020 Detects modification of shell startup/logout scripts such as ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, or /etc/profile, followed by anomalous process execution or network connections upon interactive or remote shell login. AN0060 macOS Enterprise DET0020 Correlates zsh shell configuration file changes (e.g., ~/.zshrc, ~/.zlogin, /etc/zprofile) with execution of unauthorized binaries or unexpected network activity triggered on Terminal.app launch. AN0061 Windows Enterprise DET0021 Adversary disables or stops critical services (e.g., Exchange, SQL, AV, endpoint monitoring) using native utilities or API calls, often preceding destructive actions (T1485, T1486). Behavioral chain: Elevated execution context + stop-service or sc.exe or ChangeServiceConfigW + terminated or disabled service + possible follow-up file manipulation. AN0062 Linux Enterprise DET0021 Adversary executes systemctl or service stop targeting high-value services (e.g., mysql, sshd), possibly followed by rm or shred against data stores. Behavioral chain: sudo/su usage + stop command + /var/log/messages or syslog entries + file access/delete. AN0063 macOS Enterprise DET0021 Use of launchctl to stop services or kill critical background processes (e.g., securityd, com.apple.*), typically followed by command-line tools like rm or diskutil. Behavioral chain: Terminal or remote shell + launchctl bootout/disable + process termination + follow-on modification. AN0064 ESXi Enterprise DET0021 Attacker disables VM-related services or stops VMs forcibly to target vmdk or logs. Behavioral chain: esxcli or vim-cmd stop + audit log showing user privilege use + datastore file manipulation. AN0065 Windows Enterprise DET0022 Adversary stages a lure that references a remote resource (e.g., LNK/SCF/Office template). When the user opens/renders the file or a shell enumerates icons, the host automatically attempts SMB or WebDAV authentication to the attacker host. The chain is: (1) lure file is created or modified in a user-exposed location \u2192 (2) user or system accesses the lure \u2192 (3) host makes outbound NTLM (SMB 139/445 or WebDAV over 80/443) to an untrusted destination \u2192 (4) repeated attempts from multiple users/hosts or from privileged workstations. AN0066 Windows Enterprise DET0023 Detection of unpacking behavior through abnormal memory allocation, followed by executable code injection and execution from non-image sections.

AN0070 macOS Enterprise DET0024 Detects abnormal interaction with memory-based Kerberos ccache (API:{uuid}) or file-based overrides. Focus on processes attempting to enumerate or extract Kerberos tickets outside of built-in utilities. Detects use of open-source tools (e.g., Bifrost, modified Mimikatz ports) that interact with the Kerberos framework APIs. AN0071 Windows Enterprise DET0025 Abuse of trusted Electron apps (Teams, Slack, Chrome) to spawn child processes or execute payloads via malicious command-line arguments (e.g., --gpu-launcher) and modified app resources (.asar). Behavior chain: suspicious parent process (Electron app) \u2192 unusual command-line args \u2192 child process creation \u2192 optional DLL/network artifacts. AN0072 Linux Enterprise DET0025 Abuse of Linux Electron binaries by modifying app.asar or config JS files and spawning unexpected child processes (bash, curl, python). AN0073 macOS Enterprise DET0025 Abuse of macOS Electron apps by modifying app.asar bundles and spawning child processes (osascript, curl, sh) from Electron executables.

Includes sudden increases in network interface stats, especially in dormant or low-util apps. AN0084 IaaS Enterprise DET0028 Virtual instances or workloads generating sustained outbound data rates, often to TOR, VPN, or proxy endpoints. Often coincides with unusual IAM usage or deployed scripts (e.g., cron jobs using proxy clients). AN0085 Windows Enterprise DET0029 Adversary uses a tool like Ruler to insert a malicious custom form into the user's Outlook mailbox. The form is designed to auto-execute on Outlook startup or on receipt of a specially crafted email. This results in child processes launched from outlook.exe and possibly network connections or payload loading. AN0086 Office Suite Enterprise DET0029 Outlook form execution upon message receipt or client launch results in automated code execution within user session. Form definitions deviate from standard templates and include script logic or COM object calls embedded in form fields. AN0087 IaaS Enterprise DET0030 Detects modifications to IAM conditions or policies that alter authentication behavior, such as adding permissive trusted IPs, removing MFA requirements, or changing regional access restrictions.

Includes rm -rf /mnt/volumes/, container breakout followed by host deletion attempts. AN0417 SaaS Enterprise DET0147 Adversary gains access to cloud-hosted services such as AWS SES, SNS, or OpenAI API, enables or modifies usage policies, and initiates resource-intensive actions (e.g., mass email/SMS or LLM queries), often from unauthorized regions or under anomalous identity conditions. AN0418 Identity Provider Enterprise DET0148 Forged SAML tokens can be observed as authentication attempts with valid signatures but missing expected preceding Kerberos or authentication events. Defenders may correlate SAML assertions with absent Event IDs 4769, 1200, or 1202, or tokens issued with abnormal lifetimes, issuers, or claims compared to baseline. AN0419 IaaS Enterprise DET0148 Forged SAML tokens in IaaS environments often manifest as cross-cloud or cross-account authentication without matching STS events. Defenders may see AssumeRole or GetFederationToken API usage without a corresponding SAML assertion log from the trusted IdP. AN0420 Windows Enterprise DET0148 Forged SAML tokens may be used on Windows systems to authenticate to federated apps without normal Kerberos activity. Defenders may detect anomalous event correlation, where access to SaaS/O365 via SAML occurs without prior TGT requests or user logons. AN0421 SaaS Enterprise DET0148 Forged SAML tokens can appear as SaaS logins where authentication succeeded without MFA, or where tokens contain claims inconsistent with the user profile. Look for concurrent sessions across different geographies with the same SAML assertion ID. AN0422 Office Suite Enterprise DET0148 Forged SAML tokens may be leveraged to access O365 apps such as Outlook or SharePoint. Defenders should monitor for token replay across multiple clients or access attempts to privileged mailboxes without prior interactive login.

AN0461 Network Devices Enterprise DET0161 Chain: (1) privileged CLI sessions run read-only commands that dump AAA/password policies (e.g., show aaa, show password-policy); (2) same account changes AAA or user DB shortly after. Use network device AAA/command accounting or syslog. AN0462 Windows Enterprise DET0162 Adversary installs/uses packet-capture or raw-socket capability (WinPcap/Npcap, wpcap/packet DLLs or raw socket attach) and sets a filter. A crafted inbound packet is observed; within a short window the host process that loaded capture libraries initiates an outbound connection (e.g., reverse shell) to the packet origin. AN0463 Linux Enterprise DET0162 Process creates a raw/packet socket and attaches a (e)BPF filter (setsockopt SO_ATTACH_FILTER/ATTACH_BPF or bpf(BPF_PROG_LOAD)). Immediately after a matching inbound packet, the same process binds/connects outward to a remote host (reverse shell or beacon). AN0464 macOS Enterprise DET0162 Process opens /dev/bpf* (libpcap) or loads NetworkExtension filter, then after a crafted inbound packet the same process initiates an outbound connection to the trigger origin. AN0465 Network Devices Enterprise DET0163 Defenders may observe unauthorized or anomalous changes to NAT configurations, including the addition of new translation rules or modifications to existing ones. Suspicious behaviors include sudden introduction of NAT mappings bridging segmented networks, new port address translation rules that obscure true source IPs, or traffic flows inconsistent with expected network design. Multi-event correlation includes detecting configuration changes on routers/firewalls, followed by traffic traversing unexpected internal/external address pairs. AN0466 Linux Enterprise DET0164 Detects adversary behavior where the command-line arguments of a running process are overwritten in memory to spoof the process name, typically replacing it with a benign or misleading string. The detection correlates unexpected null byte sequences, discrepancies between /proc/<pid>/cmdline and process ancestry, and suspicious memory writes shortly after process start.

Observable behaviors include repeated listing or description operations for compute instances, snapshots, storage buckets, and volumes. From a defender\u2019s perspective, risky activity is often identified by new or untrusted identities making discovery calls (e.g., DescribeInstances, ListBuckets, az vm list, gcloud compute instances list), enumeration from unusual geolocations or IPs, or rapid multi-service discovery in sequence. Correlating discovery API usage with later snapshot creation or instance modification provides further context of adversary behavior. AN0482 Network Devices Enterprise DET0170 Defenders may observe adversary attempts to alter or replace a network device\u2019s operating system image through anomalous CLI commands, unexpected firmware updates, integrity check failures, or mismatches in version and checksum validation. Suspicious behavior includes modification of image files on storage, OS version output inconsistent with baselines, unexpected reloads or reboots after image replacement, and changes to boot configuration that load non-standard system images. AN0483 IaaS Enterprise DET0171 Forged cookies in IaaS environments may appear as authentication attempts that bypass MFA, leveraging AssumeRole or session APIs with cookies that were never legitimately issued. Defenders should correlate cloud logs for cookie-based sessions without prior valid authentication, often followed by resource access from unfamiliar IP addresses. AN0484 Windows Enterprise DET0171 Forged web cookies on Windows endpoints can be detected by monitoring unusual modifications of browser cookie stores (e.g., Chrome SQLite DB, Edge cache) by processes outside of browsers, followed by authentication events to SaaS or IaaS services. Defenders may observe processes writing directly to cookie storage paths or injecting tokens into browser sessions. AN0485 Linux Enterprise DET0171 On Linux, defenders may observe forged cookie activity as unauthorized modifications to browser cookie databases (e.g., ~/.mozilla/firefox/*/cookies.sqlite, ~/.config/chromium/Default/Cookies) or scripted injection of session tokens. Suspicious usage includes curl/wget commands embedding forged cookies in headers, correlated with abnormal session activity in SaaS or IaaS logs. AN0486 macOS Enterprise DET0171 Forged cookies on macOS may show up as abnormal access to Safari/Chrome cookie databases in ~/Library/Cookies, combined with unexpected logon sessions authenticated by those cookies. Unified Logs may show cookie injection events or abnormal access patterns to Keychain when linked to browser authentication flows. AN0487 SaaS Enterprise DET0171 Forged cookies in SaaS environments manifest as valid web sessions without matching login activity, MFA enforcement bypass, or cookies reused across multiple devices/IPs. Defenders should look for cookie replay, concurrent sessions from multiple geographies, or session tokens generated by unrecognized apps.

Defender view focuses on registry tampering, suspicious DLL loads into trusted processes, and abnormal trust validation failures correlated across event streams. AN1223 Linux Enterprise DET0443 Detects anomalous process execution patterns where a process's parent terminates quickly after process creation or is re-parented to 'init' (PID 1), often indicating double-fork or daemon-style detachment. These behaviors sever the parent-child relationship and obscure the execution origin in process tree analysis. AN1224 macOS Enterprise DET0443 Detects execution patterns where a child process is detached from its original parent, often showing up under 'launchd' (PID 1) with no parent lineage. These breakages in the process tree are indicative of evasive techniques using daemon(), fork() or background execution flags. AN1225 Windows Enterprise DET0444 Detects suspicious usage of common application-layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SMB) by abnormal processes, with high outbound byte counts or irregular ports, possibly indicating command and control or data exfiltration.
