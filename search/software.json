"content": " Software Software is a generic term for custom or commercial code, operating system utilities, open-source software, or other tools used to conduct behavior modeled in ATT&CK. Some instances of software have multiple names associated with the same instance due to various organizations tracking the same set of software by different names. The team makes a best effort to track overlaps between names based on publicly reported associations, which are designated as \u201cAssociated Software\u201d on each page (formerly labeled \u201cAliases\u201d), because we believe these overlaps are useful for analyst awareness. Software entries include publicly reported technique use or capability to use a technique and may be mapped to Groups who have been reported to use that Software. The information provided does not represent all possible technique use by a piece of Software, but rather a subset that is available solely through open source reporting. Tool - Commercial, open-source, built-in, or publicly available software that could be used by a defender, pen tester, red teamer, or an adversary. This category includes both software that generally is not found on an enterprise system as well as software generally available as part of an operating system that is already present in an environment. Examples include PsExec, Metasploit, Mimikatz, as well as Windows utilities such as Net, netstat, Tasklist, etc. Malware - Commercial, custom closed source, or open source software intended to be used for malicious purposes by adversaries. Examples include PlugX, CHOPSTICK, etc. Software: 794 ID Name Associated Software Description S0066 3PARA RAT 3PARA RAT is a remote access tool (RAT) programmed in C++ that has been used by Putter Panda.

exec(@s); [1] ICS T0885 Commonly Used Port Stuxnet attempts to contact command and control servers on port 80 to send basic information about the computer it has compromised. [1] ICS T0866 Exploitation of Remote Services Stuxnet executes malicious SQL commands in the WinCC database server to propagate to remote systems. The malicious SQL commands include xp_cmdshell, sp_dumpdbilog, and sp_addextendedproc. [1] ICS T0891 Hardcoded Credentials Stuxnet uses a hardcoded password in the WinCC software's database server as one of the mechanisms used to propagate to nearby systems. [1] ICS T0874 Hooking Stuxnet modifies the Import Address Tables DLLs to hook specific APIs that are used to open project files. [1] ICS T0877 I/O Image Stuxnet copies the input area of an I/O image into data blocks with a one second interval between copies, forming a 21 second recording of the input area. The input area contains information being passed to the PLC from a peripheral. For example, the current state of a valve or the temperature of a device. [1] ICS T0867 Lateral Tool Transfer Stuxnet sends an SQL statement that creates a table and inserts a binary value into the table. The binary value is a hex string representation of the main Stuxnet DLL as an executable file (formed using resource 210) and an updated configuration data block. [1] ICS T0835 Manipulate I/O Image When the peripheral output is written to, sequence C intercepts the output and ensures it is not written to the process image output. The output is the instructions the PLC sends to a device to change its operating behavior. By intercepting the peripheral output, Stuxnet prevents an operator from noticing unauthorized commands sent to the peripheral. [1] ICS T0831 Manipulation of Control Stuxnet can reprogram a PLC and change critical parameters in such a way that legitimate commands can be overridden or intercepted. In addition, Stuxnet can apply inappropriate command sequences or parameters to cause damage to property. [1] ICS T0832 Manipulation of View Stuxnet manipulates the view of operators replaying process input and manipulating the I/O image to evade detection and inhibit protection functions. [4] [1] ICS T0849 Masquerading Stuxnet renames s7otbxdx.dll, a dll responsible for handling communications with a PLC. It replaces this dll file with its own version that allows it to intercept any calls that are made to access the PLC. [1] ICS T0821 Modify Controller Tasking Stuxnet infects OB1 so that its malicious code sequence is executed at the start of a cycle. It also infects OB35. OB35 acts as a watchdog, and on certain conditions, it can stop the execution of OB1. [1] ICS T0836 Modify Parameter In states 3 and 4 Stuxnet sends two network bursts (done through the DP_SEND primitive). The data in the frames are instructions for the frequency converter drives. For example one of the frames contains records that change the maximum frequency (the speed at which the motor will operate). The frequency converter drives consist of parameters, which can be remotely configured via Profibus. One can write new values to these parameters changing the behavior of the device. [1] ICS T0889 Modify Program Stuxnet infects PLCs with different code depending on the characteristics of the target system. An infection sequence consists of code blocks and data blocks that will be downloaded to the PLC to alter its behavior. [1] ICS T0801 Monitor Process State Stuxnet examines fields recorded by the DP_RECV monitor to determine if the target system is in a particular state of operation. [1] ICS T0834 Native API Stuxnet calls system function blocks which are part of the operating system running on the PLC. Theyre used to execute system tasks, such as reading the system clock (SFC1) and generating data blocks on the fly. [1] ICS T0842 Network Sniffing DP_RECV is the name of a standard function block used by network coprocessors. It is used to receive network frames on the Profibus a standard industrial network bus used for distributed I/O. The original block is copied to FC1869, and then replaced by a malicious block. Each time the function is used to receive a packet, the malicious Stuxnet block takes control: it will call the original DP_RECV in FC1869 and then perform postprocessing on the packet data. The replaced DP_RECV block (later on referred to as the DP_RECV monitor) is meant to monitor data sent by the frequency converter drives to the 315-2 CPU via CP 342-5 Profibus communication modules. [1] ICS T0843 Program Download Stuxnet's infection sequence consists of code blocks and data blocks that will be downloaded to the PLC to alter its behavior. [1] ICS T0873 Project File Infection Stuxnet copies itself into Step 7 projects in such a way that it automatically executes when the Step 7 project is loaded. [1] ICS T0886 Remote Services Stuxnet executes malicious SQL commands in the WinCC database server to propagate to remote systems. The malicious SQL commands include xp_cmdshell, sp_dumpdbilog, and sp_addextendedproc. [1] ICS T0888 Remote System Information Discovery Stuxnet enumerates and parses the System Data Blocks (SDB) using the s7blk_findfirst and s7blk_findnext API calls in s7otbxdx.dll. Stuxnet must find an SDB with the DWORD at offset 50h equal to 0100CB2Ch. This specifies that the system uses the Profibus communications processor module CP 342-5. In addition, specific values are searched for and counted: 7050h and 9500h. 7050h is assigned to part number KFC750V3 which appears to be a frequency converter drive (also known as variable frequency drive) manufactured by Fararo Paya in Teheran, Iran. 9500h is assigned to Vacon NX frequency converter drives manufactured by Vacon based in Finland.[1] Stuxnet was specifically targeting CPUs 6ES7-315-2 (Series 300) with special system data block characteristics for sequence A or B and 6ES7-315-2 for sequence C. The PLC type can also be checked using the s7ag_read_szl API.[1] ICS T0847 Replication Through Removable Media Stuxnet was able to self-replicate by being spread through removable drives. A willing insider or unknown third party, such as a contractor, may have brought the removable media into the target environment. [1] The earliest version of Stuxnet relied on physical installation, infecting target systems when an infected configuration file carried by a USB stick was opened. [4] ICS T0851 Rootkit One of Stuxnet's rootkits is contained entirely in the fake s7otbxdx.dll. In order to continue existing undetected on the PLC it needs to account for at least the following situations: read requests for its own malicious code blocks, read requests for infected blocks (OB1, OB35, DP_RECV), and write requests that could overwrite Stuxnets own code. Stuxnet contains code to monitor and intercept these types of requests. The rootkit modifies these requests so that Stuxnets PLC code is not discovered or damaged. [4] ICS T0869 Standard Application Layer Protocol Stuxnet uses a thread to monitor a data block DB890 of sequence A or B. This thread is constantly running and probing this block (every 5 minutes). On an infected PLC, if block DB890 is found and contains a special magic value (used by Stuxnet to identify his own block DB890), this blocks data can be read and written. This thread is likely used to optimize the way sequences A and B work, and modify their behavior when the Step7 editor is opened. [1] ICS T0863 User Execution Stuxnet infects DLL's associated with the WinCC Simatic manager which are responsible for opening project files. If a user opens an uninfected project file using a compromised manager, the file will be infected with Stuxnet code. If an infected project is opened with the Simatic manager, the modified data file will trigger a search for the xyz.dll file. If the xyz.dll file is not found in any of the specified locations, the malicious DLL will be loaded and executed by the manager.

TsHi.py contains instances of halt and run functions being executed. [8] ICS T0885 Commonly Used Port Triton uses TriStations default UDP port, 1502, to communicate with devices. [8] ICS T0868 Detect Operating Mode Triton contains a file named TS_cnames.py which contains default definitions for program state (TS_progstate). Program state is referenced in TsHi.py.[8] Triton contains a file named TS_cnames.py which contains default definitions for key state (TS_keystate). Key state is referenced in TsHi.py.[8] ICS T0871 Execution through API Triton leverages a reconstructed TriStation protocol within its framework to trigger APIs related to program download, program allocation, and program changes. [7] ICS T0820 Exploitation for Evasion Triton disables a firmware RAM/ROM consistency check after injects a payload (imain.bin) into the firmware memory region. [3] [9] [4] Triconex systems include continuous means of detection including checksums for firmware and program integrity, memory and memory reference integrity, and configuration. [10] ICS T0890 Exploitation for Privilege Escalation Triton leverages a previously-unknown vulnerability affecting Tricon MP3008 firmware versions 10.010.4 allows an insecurely-written system call to be exploited to achieve an arbitrary 2-byte write primitive, which is then used to gain supervisor privileges. [3] ICS T0874 Hooking Triton's injector, inject.bin, changes the function pointer of the 'get main processor diagnostic data' TriStation command to the address of imain.bin so that it is executed prior to the normal handler. [7] ICS T0872 Indicator Removal on Host Triton would reset the controller to the previous state over TriStation and if this failed it would write a dummy program to memory in what was likely an attempt at anti-forensics. [7] ICS T0880 Loss of Safety Triton has the capability to reprogram the SIS logic to allow unsafe conditions to persist or reprogram the SIS to allow an unsafe state while using the DCS to create an unsafe state or hazard. [1] ICS T0849 Masquerading Triton's injector, inject.bin, masquerades as a standard compiled PowerPC program for the Tricon. [3] Triton was configured to masquerade as trilog.exe, which is the Triconex software for analyzing SIS logs.[11] ICS T0821 Modify Controller Tasking Triton's argument-setting and inject.bin shellcode are added to the program table on the Tricon so that they are executed by the firmware once each cycle. [3] [7] ICS T0834 Native API Triton's imain.bin payload takes commands from the TsHi.ExplReadRam(Ex), TsHi.ExplWriteRam(Ex) and TsHi.ExplExec functions to perform operations on controller memory and registers using syscalls written in PowerPC shellcode. [7] ICS T0843 Program Download Triton leveraged the TriStation protocol to download programs onto Triconex Safety Instrumented System. [7] ICS T0845 Program Upload Triton calls the SafeAppendProgramMod to transfer its payloads to the Tricon. Part of this call includes preforming a program upload. [8] ICS T0846 Remote System Discovery Triton uses a Python script that is capable of detecting Triconex controllers on the network by sending a specific UDP broadcast packet over port 1502. [3] ICS T0853 Scripting Triton communicates with Triconex controllers using a custom component framework written entirely in Python. The modules that implement the TriStation communication protocol and other supporting components are found in a separate file -- library.zip -- the main script that employs this functionality is compiled into a standalone py2exe Windows executable -- trilog.exe which includes a Python environment. [3] ICS T0869 Standard Application Layer Protocol Triton can communicate with the implant utilizing the TriStation 'get main processor diagnostic data' command and looks for a specifically crafted packet body from which it extracts a command value and its arguments. [7] ICS T0857 System Firmware Triton is able to read, write and execute code in memory on the safety controller at an arbitrary address within the devices firmware region. This allows the malware to make changes to the running firmware in memory and modify how the device operates.

"content": " Industroyer Industroyer is a sophisticated malware framework designed to cause an impact to the working processes of Industrial Control Systems (ICS), specifically components used in electrical substations.[1] Industroyer was used in the attacks on the Ukrainian power grid in December 2016.[2] This is the first publicly known malware specifically designed to target and impact operations in the electric grid.[3] ID: S0604 \u24d8 Associated Software: CRASHOVERRIDE, Win32/Industroyer \u24d8 Type: MALWARE \u24d8 Platforms: Windows Contributors: Dragos Threat Intelligence; Joe Slowik - Dragos Version: 1.1 Created: 04 January 2021 Last Modified: 11 April 2024 Version Permalink Live Version Associated Software Descriptions Name Description CRASHOVERRIDE [2] Win32/Industroyer [1] Techniques Used Domain ID Name Use Enterprise T1071 .001 Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols Industroyer\u2019s main backdoor connected to a remote C2 server using HTTPS.[1] Enterprise T1554 Compromise Host Software Binary Industroyer has used a Trojanized version of the Windows Notepad application for an additional backdoor persistence mechanism.[1] Enterprise T1543 .003 Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service Industroyer can use an arbitrary system service to load at system boot for persistence and replaces the ImagePath registry value of a Windows service with a new backdoor binary.[2] Enterprise T1485 Data Destruction Industroyer\u2019s data wiper module clears registry keys and overwrites both ICS configuration and Windows files.[2] Enterprise T1140 Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information Industroyer decrypts code to connect to a remote C2 server.[1] Enterprise T1499 .004 Endpoint Denial of Service: Application or System Exploitation Industroyer uses a custom DoS tool that leverages CVE-2015-5374 and targets hardcoded IP addresses of Siemens SIPROTEC devices.[1] Enterprise T1041 Exfiltration Over C2 Channel Industroyer sends information about hardware profiles and previously-received commands back to the C2 server in a POST-request.[1] Enterprise T1083 File and Directory Discovery Industroyer\u2019s data wiper component enumerates specific files on all the Windows drives.[1] Enterprise T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer Industroyer downloads a shellcode payload from a remote C2 server and loads it into memory.[1] Enterprise T1046 Network Service Discovery Industroyer uses a custom port scanner to map out a network.[1] Enterprise T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information Industroyer uses heavily obfuscated code in its Windows Notepad backdoor.[1] Enterprise T1572 Protocol Tunneling Industroyer attempts to perform an HTTP CONNECT via an internal proxy to establish a tunnel.[2] Enterprise T1090 .003 Proxy: Multi-hop Proxy Industroyer used Tor nodes for C2.[2] Enterprise T1012 Query Registry Industroyer has a data wiper component that enumerates keys in the Registry HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services.[1] Enterprise T1018 Remote System Discovery Industroyer can enumerate remote computers in the compromised network.[1] Enterprise T1489 Service Stop Industroyer\u2019s data wiper module writes zeros into the registry keys in SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services to render a system inoperable.[2] Enterprise T1082 System Information Discovery Industroyer collects the victim machine\u2019s Windows GUID.[2] Enterprise T1016 System Network Configuration Discovery Industroyer\u2019s 61850 payload component enumerates connected network adapters and their corresponding IP addresses.[1] Enterprise T1078 Valid Accounts Industroyer can use supplied user credentials to execute processes and stop services.[1] ICS T0800 Activate Firmware Update Mode The Industroyer SIPROTEC DoS module places the victim device into firmware update mode. This is a legitimate use case under normal circumstances, but in this case is used the adversary to prevent the SIPROTEC from performing its designed protective functions. As a result the normal safeguards are disabled, leaving an unprotected link in the electric transmission. [4] ICS T0802 Automated Collection Industroyer automatically collects protocol object data to learn about control devices in the environment. [5] ICS T0803 Block Command Message In Industroyer the first COM port from the configuration file is used for the actual communication and the two other COM ports are just opened to prevent other processes accessing them. Thus, the IEC 101 payload component is able to take over and maintain control of the RTU device. [5] ICS T0804 Block Reporting Message Industroyer uses the first COM port from the configuration file for the communication and the other two COM ports are opened to prevent other processes accessing them. This may block processes or operators from getting reporting messages from a device. [5] ICS T0805 Block Serial COM In Industroyer the first COM port from the configuration file is used for the actual communication and the two other COM ports are just opened to prevent other processes accessing them. Thus, the IEC 101 payload component is able to take over and maintain control of the RTU device. [5] ICS T0806 Brute Force I/O The Industroyer IEC 104 module has 3 modes available to perform its attack. These modes are range, shift, and sequence. The range mode operates in 2 stages. The first stage of range mode gathers Information Object Addresses (IOA) and sends select and execute packets to switch the state. The second stage of range mode has an infinite loop where it will switch the state of all of the previously discovered IOAs. Shift mode is similar to range mode, but instead of staying within the same range, it will add a shift value to the default range values. [5] ICS T0807 Command-Line Interface The name of the Industroyer payload DLL is supplied by the attackers via a command line parameter supplied in one of the main backdoors execute a shell command commands. [5] ICS T0884 Connection Proxy Industroyer attempts to connect with a hardcoded internal proxy on TCP 3128 [default Squid proxy]. If established, the backdoor attempts to reach an external C2 server via the internal proxy. [6] ICS T0809 Data Destruction Industroyer has a destructive wiper that overwrites all ICS configuration files across the hard drives and all mapped network drives specifically targeting ABB PCM600 configuration files. [6] ICS T0813 Denial of Control Industroyer is able to block serial COM channels temporarily causing a denial of control. [5] ICS T0814 Denial of Service The Industroyer SIPROTEC DoS module exploits the CVE-2015-5374 vulnerability in order to render a Siemens SIPROTEC device unresponsive. Once this vulnerability is successfully exploited, the target device stops responding to any commands until it is rebooted manually. [5] Once the tool is executed it sends specifically crafted packets to port 50,000 of the target IP addresses using UDP. The UDP packet contains the following 18 byte payload: 0x11 49 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 28 9E. [5] ICS T0815 Denial of View Industroyer is able to block serial COM channels temporarily causing a denial of view. [5] ICS T0816 Device Restart/Shutdown The Industroyer SIPROTEC DoS module exploits the CVE-2015-5374 vulnerability in order to render a Siemens SIPROTEC device unresponsive. While the vulnerability does not directly cause the restart or shutdown of the device, the device must be restarted manually before it can resume operations. [5] ICS T0827 Loss of Control Industroyer's data wiper component removes the registry image path throughout the system and overwrites all files, rendering the system unusable. [5] ICS T0837 Loss of Protection Industroyer contained a module which leveraged a vulnerability in the Siemens SIPROTEC relays (CVE-2015-5374) to create a Denial of Service against automated protective relays. [4] ICS T0829 Loss of View Industroyer's data wiper component removes the registry image path throughout the system and overwrites all files, rendering the system unusable. [5] ICS T0831 Manipulation of Control Industroyer toggles breakers to the open state utilizing unauthorized command messages. [5] ICS T0832 Manipulation of View Industroyer's OPC module can brute force values and will send out a 0x01 status which for the target systems equates to a Primary Variable Out of Limits misdirecting operators from understanding protective relay status. [5] ICS T0801 Monitor Process State Industroyer's OPC and IEC 61850 protocol modules include the ability to send stVal requests to read the status of operational variables. [5] ICS T0840 Network Connection Enumeration Industroyer contains an IEC 61850 module that enumerates all connected network adapters to determine their TCP/IP subnet masks. [5] ICS T0846 Remote System Discovery The Industroyer IEC 61850 payload component has the ability to discover relevant devices in the infected host's network subnet by attempting to connect on port 102.[5] Industroyer contains an OPC DA module that enumerates all OPC servers using the ICatInformation::EnumClassesOfCategories method with CATID_OPCDAServer20 category identifier and IOPCServer::GetStatus to identify the ones running. ICS T0888 Remote System Information Discovery The Industroyer IEC 61850 component sends the domain-specific MMSgetNameList request to determine what logical nodes the device supports. It then searches the logical nodes for the CSW value, which indicates the device performs a circuit breaker or switch control function.[1] Industroyer's OPC DA module also uses IOPCBrowseServerAddressSpace to look for items with the following strings: ctlSelOn, ctlOperOn, ctlSelOff, ctlOperOff, Pos and stVal.[1] Industroyer IEC 60870-5-104 module includes a range mode to discover Information Object Addresses (IOAs) by enumerating through each.[1] ICS T0881 Service Stop Industroyer has the capability to stop a service itself, or to login as a user and stop a service as that user. [5] ICS T0855 Unauthorized Command Message Using its protocol payloads, Industroyer sends unauthorized commands to RTUs to change the state of equipment.
