                            The security community tracks intrusion activity using various analytic methodologies and terms, such as operations, intrusion sets, and campaigns.
                            Some intrusion activity may be referenced by a variety of names due to different organizations tracking similar activity, often from different vantage points;
                            conversely other times reported activity is not given a designated name.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Malicious cyber activity may be attributed to a threat group, or referenced as unattributed activity.
                            Alternatively, complex cyber operations may involve multiple affiliated or unaffiliated groups, with each playing a unique role
                            (ie. initial access, data exfiltration, etc).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the purposes of the Campaigns page, the MITRE ATT&CK team uses the term Campaign to describe any grouping of intrusion activity
                            conducted over a specific period of time with common targets and objectives.
                            Unnamed intrusion activity is cited using a unique ATT&CK identifier, otherwise the team will use the activity name as noted in public reporting.
                            For named Campaigns, the team makes a best effort to track overlapping names, which are designated as “Associated Campaigns” on each page,
                            as we believe these overlaps are useful for analysts.
                            Campaign entries will also be attributed to ATT&CK Group and Software pages, when possible, based on public reporting;
                            unattributed activity will simply reference “threat actors” in the procedure example.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Campaigns are mapped to publicly reporting techniques and original references are included.
                            The information provided does not represent all possible techniques used in a Campaign but rather a subset that is available through open source reporting.
                        </p>

Initial access for <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0038">HomeLand Justice</a> was established in May 2021 as threat actors subsequently moved laterally, exfiltrated sensitive information, and maintained persistence for approximately 14 months prior to the attacks. Responsibility was claimed by the "HomeLand Justice" front whose messaging indicated targeting of the Mujahedeen-e Khalq (MEK), an Iranian opposition group who maintain a refugee camp in Albania, and were formerly designated a terrorist organization by the US State Department. A second wave of attacks was launched in September 2022 using similar tactics after public attribution of the previous activity to Iran and the severing of diplomatic ties between Iran and Albania.</p>

Victims of this campaign included government, consulting, technology, telecom, and other organizations in North America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. This activity has been labled the StellarParticle campaign in industry reporting. Industry reporting also initially referred to the actors involved in this campaign as UNC2452, NOBELIUM, Dark Halo, and SolarStorm. </p><p>In April 2021, the US and UK governments attributed the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0024">SolarWinds Compromise</a> to Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR); public statements included citations to <a href="/groups/G0016">APT29</a>, Cozy Bear, and The Dukes. The US government assessed that of the approximately 18,000 affected public and private sector customers of Solar Winds’ Orion product, a much smaller number were compromised by follow-on <a href="/groups/G0016">APT29</a> activity on their systems. </p>
